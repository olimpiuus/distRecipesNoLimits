Perfect for meal prep and easy to make!","cookingSteps":[{"name":"Whisk the Egg Mixture","description":"In a medium-sized bowl, crack 3 eggs and add 1/4 cup of unsweetened almond milk. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Using a whisk or fork, beat the mixture until it is well combined and frothy. This will incorporate air into the eggs, making your scramble fluffy."},{"name":"Heat the Skillet","description":"Place a skillet on the stove over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Allow the oil to heat up until it shimmers but does not smoke. This is crucial for preventing the eggs from sticking and for enhancing the flavor."},{"name":"Cook the Chicken and Spinach","description":"Once the oil is hot, add 1 cup of shredded cooked chicken breast to the skillet. Stir for about 1 minute until heated through. Next, add 1 cup of fresh spinach. Continue to stir until the spinach wilts, which should take about 2-3 minutes. This adds a vibrant color and vital nutrients to your scramble."},{"name":"Add the Egg Mixture","description":"Pour the beaten egg mixture over the chicken and spinach in the skillet. Use a spatula to gently stir the mixture, ensuring the eggs are evenly distributed. Cook for about 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the eggs are set but still moist. Be careful not to overcook, as this can make the eggs rubbery."},{"name":"Serve and Enjoy","description":"Once the eggs are fully cooked, remove the skillet from the heat. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Serve immediately while hot, garnished with additional pepper or herbs if desired."}],"pairings":{"pairings":"Pair this Almond Milk Chicken Scramble with whole grain toast or avocado slices for added texture and healthy fats. For beverages, consider a fresh orange juice or herbal tea to complement the savory flavors of the dish. If you want a heartier meal, serve it alongside a mixed green salad with a light vinaigrette.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the Almond Milk Chicken Scramble warm in individual bowls, garnished with fresh herbs like parsley or chives for a pop of color and flavor. You can also sprinkle some crumbled feta or goat cheese on top for added creaminess and tang. For a brunch setting, serve it with a side of fruit salad or yogurt for a balanced meal.","dietary_considerations":"This dish is naturally gluten-free and can be made dairy-free by using unsweetened almond milk. For a lower-fat version, use egg whites instead of whole eggs. If following a keto diet, consider replacing the almond milk with heavy cream for a richer scramble. You can also add in other vegetables, like bell peppers or mushrooms, to enhance its nutritional profile."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I prepare fresh spinach for cooking?","answer":"To prepare fresh spinach, rinse it under cold water to remove any dirt or grit. Then, remove any tough stems if necessary. You can leave the leaves whole or roughly chop them, depending on your preference."},{"question":"What is the best way to shred cooked chicken breast?","answer":"To shred cooked chicken breast, use two forks. Hold one fork in each hand, and pull the chicken apart in opposite directions. Alternatively, you can use your hands if the chicken is cool enough to handle."},{"question":"How do I know when the eggs are fully cooked?","answer":"The eggs are fully cooked when they are no longer runny and have a soft, set texture. For a scramble, stir occasionally and look for a light, fluffy consistency, which usually takes about 3-5 minutes on medium heat."},{"question":"Can I use other types of milk instead of almond milk?","answer":"Yes! You can substitute almond milk with any milk you prefer, such as cow's milk, soy milk, or oat milk. Just note that the flavor may vary slightly."},{"question":"What does 'season to taste' mean?","answer":"'Season to taste' means adding salt, pepper, or other seasonings according to your personal preference. Start with a small amount, taste your dish, and adjust as needed."},{"question":"How can I prevent my eggs from sticking to the skillet?","answer":"To prevent sticking, ensure your skillet is preheated and add enough olive oil (or another cooking fat) to coat the bottom. Using a non-stick skillet can also help."},{"question":"What is the best way to whisk eggs?","answer":"To whisk eggs, use a fork or a whisk. Beat the eggs vigorously in a bowl until the yolks and whites are fully combined and the mixture is slightly frothy."},{"question":"How can I tell if olive oil is hot enough?","answer":"Olive oil is hot enough when it shimmers and moves easily in the pan. You can also test it by adding a small piece of food; if it sizzles, the oil is ready."},{"question":"Can I add other vegetables to this scramble?","answer":"Absolutely! Feel free to add any vegetables you like, such as bell peppers, onions, or tomatoes. Just make sure to sauté them before adding the eggs so they cook through."},{"question":"What should I do if I overcook the eggs?","answer":"If you accidentally overcook the eggs, they may become dry and rubbery. To remedy this, serve them with a sauce or salsa to add moisture, or mix in a little cheese for creaminess."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"cooked chicken breast, shredded","advice":"Use rotisserie chicken for a quick option, or substitute with cooked turkey or tofu for a vegetarian version. Ensure the chicken is not overly dry; adding a bit of chicken broth while cooking can help keep it moist."},{"name":"eggs","advice":"Fresh eggs are best for flavor and texture. If you need a cholesterol-free option, use egg whites or a plant-based egg substitute. You can also add a pinch of turmeric for color."},{"name":"unsweetened almond milk","advice":"If you don't have almond milk, other plant-based milks such as soy, oat, or coconut can be used. For a creamier texture, mix in a little coconut cream or use regular dairy milk if preferred."},{"name":"spinach, fresh","advice":"Fresh spinach wilts down nicely, but you can substitute frozen spinach if needed—just make sure to thaw and drain it well.

Consider using flavored salts like garlic salt or herb salt for added depth."},{"name":"pepper","advice":"Freshly cracked black pepper provides the best flavor. You can also experiment with other peppers, like cayenne for heat or white pepper for a milder flavor."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Extra virgin olive oil adds a robust flavor, but you can substitute with avocado oil or melted butter for a different taste profile. For added flavor, infuse the oil with garlic or herbs before cooking."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673ace374260099cc64fd6f3","name":"Almond Milk Chicken Scramble","ingredients":[{"name":"cooked chicken breast, shredded","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673ace394260099cc64fd700"},{"name":"eggs","quantity":"3","_id":"673ace394260099cc64fd701"},{"name":"unsweetened almond milk","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"673ace394260099cc64fd702"},{"name":"spinach, fresh","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673ace394260099cc64fd703"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673ace394260099cc64fd704"},{"name":"pepper","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673ace394260099cc64fd705"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"1 tablespoon","_id":"673ace394260099cc64fd706"}],"calories":350,"allergens":["Eggs","Almonds"],"dietaryTags":["Gluten-Free","Low-Carb","Dairy-Free"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":6.5,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":10,"tags":["Quick Meal","Healthy","Breakfast","Protein-Packed"],"quickTastyDescription":"A creamy, protein-packed chicken scramble made with almond milk for a delightful twist!","detailedCookingInstructions":["In a bowl, whisk together eggs, almond milk, salt, and pepper until well combined.","In a skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat.","Add the shredded chicken and spinach to the skillet, cooking until the spinach is wilted.","Pour the egg mixture over the chicken and spinach, stirring gently as it cooks.","Cook until the eggs are set, about 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally."],"createdByModel":"4o","detailedName":"Creamy Almond Milk Chicken Scramble","baseMeal":"Scrambled Eggs","modifiersForBase":"With chicken and almond milk","imageUrl":"/images/almond-milk-chicken-scramble-673ace374260099cc64fd6f7.webp","image":"673ace374260099cc64fd6f7","servings":2,"cuisine":["American"],"course":["Breakfast","Brunch"],"dateCreated":"2024-11-18T05:18:49.248Z","createdAt":"2024-11-18T05:18:49.249Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-19T05:35:49.305Z","__v":0,"mealUrl":"almond-milk-chicken-scramble-673ace374260099cc64fd6f3"},"__v":0}}
