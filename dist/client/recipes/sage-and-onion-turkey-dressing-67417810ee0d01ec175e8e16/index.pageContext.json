For beverages, consider a crisp white wine like Sauvignon Blanc or a light-bodied red wine such as Pinot Noir. If you prefer non-alcoholic options, a sparkling apple cider or herbal iced tea would work well.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the dressing warm, straight from the oven, garnished with fresh sage leaves for a pop of color. It can be served as a side dish during Thanksgiving, Christmas, or any family gathering. For an elevated presentation, consider serving it in a hollowed-out pumpkin or squash for a festive touch.","dietary_considerations":"This dressing can be made gluten-free by using gluten-free bread crumbs.

If you're looking for a vegetarian version, simply omit the chicken broth and use vegetable broth instead."},"faqs":[{"question":"What is the best way to chop an onion without crying?","answer":"To minimize tears while chopping onions, try chilling the onion in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before cutting. Additionally, using a sharp knife can help reduce cell damage that releases the tear-inducing gas. Also, cutting the onion under running water can help wash away the gas."},{"question":"How do I know when the onions are sautéed properly?","answer":"You want the onions to be translucent and slightly golden. This usually takes about 5-7 minutes over medium heat. Stir them frequently to ensure they cook evenly and don’t burn."},{"question":"What can I substitute for fresh sage?","answer":"If you don’t have fresh sage, you can use dried sage, but use it sparingly as dried herbs are more concentrated in flavor. About 1 teaspoon of dried sage can replace 2 tablespoons of fresh sage."},{"question":"How do I know when the dressing is done baking?","answer":"The dressing is done when the top is golden brown and crispy. You can also insert a knife into the center; if it comes out clean, it’s ready."},{"question":"Can I make this dressing ahead of time?","answer":"Yes!

Wash your hands and any surfaces that come into contact with raw eggs to prevent cross-contamination. If you’re concerned about salmonella, you can use pasteurized eggs."},{"question":"How do I know the right size for my baking dish?","answer":"For this recipe, a 9x9-inch baking dish works well.

It's a classic Thanksgiving side!"},{"question":"How can I add more flavor to my dressing?","answer":"You can enhance the flavor by adding ingredients like garlic, celery, or even nuts and dried fruits. Feel free to experiment and find your favorite combination!"}],"ingredients":[{"name":"bread crumbs","advice":"For a healthier option, you can use whole grain bread crumbs or gluten-free alternatives made from rice or corn. If you don't have bread crumbs, you can make your own by toasting bread and grinding it in a food processor. For extra flavor, consider using seasoned bread crumbs."},{"name":"onion, finely chopped","advice":"You can substitute yellow onions with shallots for a milder flavor or red onions for a sweeter taste. To enhance the sweetness, you can caramelize the onions instead of just sautéing them, which will add depth to the dressing."},{"name":"fresh sage, chopped","advice":"If fresh sage is unavailable, you can use dried sage, but use only about 1 tablespoon since dried herbs are more concentrated. To enhance the sage flavor, consider lightly bruising the leaves before chopping them to release more oils."},{"name":"butter","advice":"You can substitute with olive oil or coconut oil for a dairy-free option. If using oil, consider adding a little extra for richness. For a more robust flavor, try using herb-infused butter."},{"name":"chicken broth","advice":"Vegetable broth can be used as a substitute for a vegetarian option. For a richer flavor, you can use homemade broth or low-sodium broth to control the saltiness. Adding a splash of white wine can also enhance the overall flavor."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Make sure to adjust the salt based on the saltiness of the broth you are using. If you're watching your sodium intake, consider using a salt substitute or simply reducing the amount to your taste."},{"name":"pepper","advice":"Freshly cracked black pepper will provide a more robust flavor than pre-ground pepper. You can also experiment with white pepper for a different heat profile, or add a pinch of cayenne for a bit of spice."},{"name":"egg, beaten","advice":"The egg acts as a binder for the dressing. If you need an egg substitute, you can use 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce or a flaxseed egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water). This will help hold the mixture together without compromising flavor."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"_id":"67417810ee0d01ec175e8e16","name":"Sage and Onion Turkey Dressing","ingredients":[{"name":"bread crumbs","quantity":"4 cups","_id":"67417815ee0d01ec175e8e21"},{"name":"onion, finely chopped","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"67417815ee0d01ec175e8e22"},{"name":"fresh sage, chopped","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"67417815ee0d01ec175e8e23"},{"name":"butter","quantity":"1/2 cup","_id":"67417815ee0d01ec175e8e24"},{"name":"chicken broth","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"67417815ee0d01ec175e8e25"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"67417815ee0d01ec175e8e26"},{"name":"pepper","quantity":"1/2 teaspoon","_id":"67417815ee0d01ec175e8e27"},{"name":"egg, beaten","quantity":"1","_id":"67417815ee0d01ec175e8e28"}],"calories":200,"allergens":["Gluten","Dairy"],"dietaryTags":["Vegetarian"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":5,"preparationTime":15,"cookingTime":30,"tags":["Easy","Thanksgiving","Side Dish"],"quickTastyDescription":"A savory blend of sage and onion that perfectly complements your turkey for a holiday feast.","detailedCookingInstructions":["Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).","In a skillet, melt butter over medium heat.
