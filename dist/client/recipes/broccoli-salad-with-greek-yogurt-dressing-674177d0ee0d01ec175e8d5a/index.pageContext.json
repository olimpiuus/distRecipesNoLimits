After that, rinse it under running water. To prepare it, cut off the thick stem and separate the florets into bite-sized pieces using a sharp knife."},{"question":"What’s the best way to chop an onion without tearing up?","answer":"To minimize tears while chopping onions, try chilling the onion in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before cutting. Use a sharp knife, as dull knives can crush the onion cells and release more tear-inducing compounds."},{"question":"How can I make sure my salad dressing is well mixed?","answer":"When making salad dressing, start by combining the ingredients in a small bowl and whisk them together vigorously. If you find it difficult to mix, you can also put the ingredients in a jar with a lid and shake it until combined."},{"question":"What can I use instead of honey in the dressing?","answer":"If you need a substitute for honey, consider using maple syrup or agave syrup. Both will add sweetness and work well with the other ingredients in the dressing."},{"question":"How do I know when to add salt and pepper to my dish?","answer":"Tasting is key! Start with a small amount of salt and pepper, mix, and taste again. Remember, you can always add more, but you can't take it out once it's in."},{"question":"Can I prepare this salad in advance?","answer":"Yes! You can prepare this salad a few hours ahead of time. Just keep the dressing separate until you're ready to serve to prevent the broccoli from becoming soggy."},{"question":"What’s the purpose of adding sunflower seeds?","answer":"Sunflower seeds add a nice crunch and nutty flavor to the salad.

It’s best consumed within 2-3 days for optimal freshness."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"fresh broccoli florets","advice":"Choose bright green florets with no yellowing or brown spots. For a more tender texture, you can blanch them in boiling water for 1-2 minutes before cooling in ice water. If fresh is unavailable, frozen broccoli can be used, but it may have a softer texture."},{"name":"cherry tomatoes","advice":"Look for plump, firm tomatoes with vibrant color. If you want a sweeter flavor, allow them to ripen at room temperature for a few days. Substitute with grape tomatoes or even diced regular tomatoes if cherry tomatoes are not available."},{"name":"red onion","advice":"Red onions have a milder flavor compared to yellow onions, making them great for salads. Soak the chopped red onion in cold water for 10 minutes before adding it to the salad to mellow its sharpness. If you prefer a sweeter taste, use Vidalia onions."},{"name":"greek yogurt","advice":"Opt for plain, unsweetened Greek yogurt for the dressing. You can substitute it with sour cream, or for a dairy-free option, try coconut yogurt or a cashew cream. To enhance flavor, consider adding a squeeze of lemon juice or some fresh herbs."},{"name":"apple cider vinegar","advice":"This adds a tangy flavor to your dressing. If you don’t have it, white wine vinegar or lemon juice can be good substitutes. To balance the acidity, consider adding a pinch of sugar or more honey."},{"name":"honey","advice":"Use raw honey for a more complex flavor, but maple syrup or agave nectar can be good vegan alternatives. Adjust the sweetness to your preference; start with a little and add more if needed."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Use sea salt or kosher salt for better flavor. Start with a small amount, as you can always add more later. If you need a low-sodium option, consider using herbs and spices to boost flavor without the salt."},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly ground black pepper provides the best flavor. If you like heat, consider adding a pinch of red pepper flakes or a dash of hot sauce to the dressing for extra flavor."},{"name":"sunflower seeds","advice":"These add a nice crunch and nutty flavor. You can substitute with pumpkin seeds or chopped nuts like almonds or walnuts. Toast them lightly in a dry pan to enhance their flavor."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"_id":"674177d0ee0d01ec175e8d5a","name":"Broccoli Salad with Greek Yogurt Dressing","ingredients":[{"name":"fresh broccoli florets","quantity":"4 cups","_id":"674177d3ee0d01ec175e8d66"},{"name":"cherry tomatoes","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"674177d3ee0d01ec175e8d67"},{"name":"red onion","quantity":"1/4 cup, finely chopped","_id":"674177d3ee0d01ec175e8d68"},{"name":"greek yogurt","quantity":"1/2 cup","_id":"674177d3ee0d01ec175e8d69"},{"name":"apple cider vinegar","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"674177d3ee0d01ec175e8d6a"},{"name":"honey","quantity":"1 tablespoon","_id":"674177d3ee0d01ec175e8d6b"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"to taste","_id":"674177d3ee0d01ec175e8d6c"},{"name":"black pepper","quantity":"to taste","_id":"674177d3ee0d01ec175e8d6d"},{"name":"sunflower seeds","quantity":"1/4 cup, optional","_id":"674177d3ee0d01ec175e8d6e"}],"calories":180,"allergens":["Dairy"],"dietaryTags":["Healthy","Vegetarian","Gluten-Free"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":8,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":0,"tags":["Salad","Easy","Quick","Healthy"],"quickTastyDescription":"A fresh and crunchy broccoli salad coated in a creamy Greek yogurt dressing, perfect for a nutritious side dish.","detailedCookingInstructions":["Wash and chop the broccoli into bite-sized florets.","Halve the cherry tomatoes and add them to a large bowl.","Finely chop the red onion and add it to the bowl.","In a separate small bowl, mix the Greek yogurt, apple cider vinegar, honey, salt, and black pepper to create the dressing.","Pour the dressing over the broccoli mixture and toss until all ingredients are well coated.","Sprinkle with sunflower seeds if desired for added crunch.","Serve immediately or refrigerate for 30 minutes to enhance the flavors."],"createdByModel":"4o","detailedName":"Easy Broccoli Salad with Creamy Greek Yogurt Dressing","baseMeal":"Salad","modifiersForBase":"With Greek Yogurt Dressing","imageUrl":"/images/broccoli-salad-with-greek-yogurt-dressing-674177d0ee0d01ec175e8d60.webp","image":"674177d0ee0d01ec175e8d60","servings":4,"cuisine":["American"],"course":["Side Dish","Salad"],"mealUrl":"broccoli-salad-with-greek-yogurt-dressing-674177d0ee0d01ec175e8d5a","SEOLongkeywords":["easy broccoli salad","healthy salad recipe","broccoli salad with yogurt","quick side dish","vegetarian salad"],"dateCreated":"2024-11-23T06:36:03.088Z","createdAt":"2024-11-23T06:36:03.089Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-23T06:36:03.089Z","__v":0},"createdAt":"2024-11-23T06:36:15.705Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-23T06:36:15.705Z","__v":0}}
