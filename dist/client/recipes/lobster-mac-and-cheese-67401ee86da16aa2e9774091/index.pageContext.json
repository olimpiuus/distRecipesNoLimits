Garnish with a sprinkle of fresh parsley or chives for a pop of color. If opting for the baked version, let it rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the cheese to set slightly. For a more casual gathering, serve in a large dish with a serving spoon, and provide guests with a side of garlic bread for a comforting, hearty meal.","dietary_considerations":"To make this dish gluten-free, substitute elbow macaroni with gluten-free pasta and use a gluten-free flour blend for the roux.
