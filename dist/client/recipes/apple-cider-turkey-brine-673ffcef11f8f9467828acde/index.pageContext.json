If unavailable, you can substitute with apple juice, but be aware that the flavor will be less robust. To enhance the flavor, consider adding a splash of lemon juice or a hint of cinnamon."},{"name":"water","advice":"Opt for filtered water if possible, as it improves the overall taste of the brine. If you're feeling adventurous, you could use herbal tea as part of the water to add subtle flavors."},{"name":"kosher salt","advice":"Kosher salt is ideal for brining because it dissolves easily and doesn't contain additives. If you need a substitute, use table salt, but reduce the amount by about half due to its finer grains. Sea salt can also work, but be cautious with the measurement."},{"name":"brown sugar","advice":"Brown sugar adds a rich sweetness and color. For a different flavor profile, try substituting with maple syrup or honey, which will add unique undertones to the brine. Adjust the liquid quantity accordingly if using a liquid sweetener."},{"name":"whole black peppercorns","advice":"Using whole peppercorns provides a more robust flavor compared to ground pepper. If you don’t have peppercorns, use freshly ground black pepper, but use about half the amount. You can also experiment with other whole spices like allspice or coriander seeds for a different flavor."},{"name":"thyme leaves","advice":"Fresh thyme will provide a more vibrant flavor than dried thyme. If using dried, reduce the amount to about 1 teaspoon. Consider adding other herbs like sage or parsley for a more complex herbal profile."},{"name":"rosemary leaves","advice":"Fresh rosemary is aromatic and pairs well with turkey. If using dried, use only 1 teaspoon as it is more potent. Alternatively, consider using tarragon for a different flavor profile."},{"name":"bay leaves","advice":"Bay leaves are essential for depth of flavor. You can use fresh or dried; if using dried, just ensure they're crushed slightly to release their oils. If you don't have bay leaves, try using a small amount of dried oregano or basil as a substitute."},{"name":"ice","advice":"Ice is crucial for cooling down the brine quickly. If you prefer, you can use frozen water bottles instead of ice cubes to avoid diluting the brine as they melt."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673ffcef11f8f9467828acde","name":"Apple Cider Turkey Brine","ingredients":[{"name":"apple cider","quantity":"1 gallon","_id":"673ffcf111f8f9467828acfd"},{"name":"water","quantity":"1 gallon","_id":"673ffcf111f8f9467828acfe"},{"name":"kosher salt","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673ffcf111f8f9467828acff"},{"name":"brown sugar","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673ffcf111f8f9467828ad00"},{"name":"whole black peppercorns","quantity":"1 tablespoon","_id":"673ffcf111f8f9467828ad01"},{"name":"thyme leaves","quantity":"2 teaspoons","_id":"673ffcf111f8f9467828ad02"},{"name":"rosemary leaves","quantity":"2 teaspoons","_id":"673ffcf111f8f9467828ad03"},{"name":"bay leaves","quantity":"2","_id":"673ffcf111f8f9467828ad04"},{"name":"ice","quantity":"4 cups","_id":"673ffcf111f8f9467828ad05"}],"calories":0,"allergens":[],"dietaryTags":["Gluten-Free","Dairy-Free","Nut-Free"],"difficultyPercent":10,"price":10,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":0,"tags":["Brine","Turkey","Thanksgiving","Easy"],"quickTastyDescription":"A flavorful brine that infuses your turkey with the sweet and tangy notes of apple cider, ensuring it's juicy and delicious!","detailedCookingInstructions":["In a large pot, combine the apple cider, water, kosher salt, and brown sugar.
