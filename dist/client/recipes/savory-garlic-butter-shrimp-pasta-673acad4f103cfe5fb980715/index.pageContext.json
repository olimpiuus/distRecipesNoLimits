This helps create a silky sauce."},{"name":"Heat the Skillet","description":"In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. This combination of fats gives the dish richness and flavor."},{"name":"Sauté Garlic","description":"Add 4 cloves of minced garlic to the skillet. Sauté for about 1 minute, stirring frequently to ensure it becomes fragrant but does not brown. Burnt garlic can impart a bitter taste to your dish."},{"name":"Cook the Shrimp","description":"Add 1 pound of peeled and deveined shrimp to the skillet. Season with salt, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes (if using). Cook the shrimp for 3-4 minutes until they turn pink and opaque. Avoid overcrowding the pan to ensure even cooking."},{"name":"Combine Pasta and Shrimp","description":"Add the drained pasta directly into the skillet with the cooked shrimp. Pour in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and toss everything together well.

Mix well to combine all ingredients."},{"name":"Serve","description":"Serve the savory garlic butter shrimp pasta immediately, garnished with extra parsley or a sprinkle of parmesan cheese if desired. Enjoy your delicious homemade meal!"}],"pairings":{"pairings":"For a well-rounded meal, pair the Savory Garlic Butter Shrimp Pasta with a crisp white wine such as Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc, which complements the dish's buttery richness and garlic notes. For a more hearty option, serve with garlic bread or a light side salad featuring arugula, cherry tomatoes, and a lemon vinaigrette to enhance the freshness. If you're looking to add protein, grilled chicken or a light seafood dish like seared scallops can be a delightful accompaniment.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the pasta hot, garnished with additional chopped parsley and freshly grated Parmesan cheese for added flavor. Consider using a large, shallow serving bowl to showcase the pasta beautifully. For a touch of elegance, drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil on top before serving. You could also add a sprinkle of lemon zest to brighten the dish. If entertaining, serve with a side of roasted vegetables or a charcuterie board to create a communal dining experience.","dietary_considerations":"This dish is naturally gluten-containing due to the pasta, but can easily be adapted for gluten-free diets by using gluten-free pasta. For a dairy-free option, substitute the butter with a plant-based alternative like vegan butter or olive oil and omit cheese. If you're looking for lower-carb options, consider zucchini noodles or spaghetti squash instead of traditional pasta. Additionally, for a pescatarian-friendly meal, ensure that the shrimp is sustainably sourced."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I know when the pasta is cooked properly?","answer":"The best way to check if pasta is done is to taste it. It should be 'al dente', meaning it should be cooked but still have a slight firmness when bitten into. Check the package for cooking time and start tasting a minute or two before the time is up."},{"question":"What’s the best way to prepare shrimp?","answer":"Make sure your shrimp are peeled and deveined before cooking. If you buy frozen shrimp, let them thaw in the refrigerator overnight or under cold running water for quick thawing. Pat them dry with a paper towel before cooking to ensure they sear properly."},{"question":"How can I avoid overcooking shrimp?","answer":"Shrimp cook very quickly, usually in 3-4 minutes. Watch for the color to change to pink and the flesh to become opaque. Remove them from the heat as soon as they reach this point to avoid a rubbery texture."},{"question":"Can I substitute other types of pasta?","answer":"Yes! You can use any type of pasta you like, such as penne, fettuccine, or even gluten-free pasta. Just adjust the cooking time according to the package instructions."},{"question":"What if I don’t have fresh parsley?","answer":"You can substitute dried parsley (1 tablespoon) if fresh is not available. Alternatively, consider using other herbs like basil or cilantro, which can also complement shrimp well."},{"question":"How do I make this dish spicier?","answer":"You can add more red pepper flakes or include a dash of hot sauce to your pasta. Start with small amounts to control the heat, as it's easier to add more than to tone it down."},{"question":"What’s the best way to store leftovers?","answer":"Allow the pasta to cool completely before transferring it to an airtight container. It can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. When reheating, add a splash of water or olive oil to keep it moist."},{"question":"Is there a way to make this dish healthier?","answer":"You can use whole wheat or vegetable-based pasta for added fiber. Additionally, you can reduce the butter or substitute it with olive oil for a lower saturated fat option."},{"question":"How do I clean and maintain my skillet?","answer":"Let your skillet cool down after cooking. Use a soft sponge and warm soapy water to clean it. Avoid using steel wool or abrasive sponges that can scratch the surface."},{"question":"What can I serve with this pasta dish?","answer":"A simple green salad or steamed vegetables like broccoli or asparagus make great sides. Garlic bread is also a delicious accompaniment!"}],"ingredients":[{"name":"shrimp, peeled and deveined","advice":"Fresh shrimp is best for flavor, but frozen shrimp can be a good substitute. If using frozen, ensure they are fully thawed before cooking. For a more intense flavor, consider marinating the shrimp briefly in lemon juice and spices before cooking."},{"name":"spaghetti or linguine","advice":"Both types of pasta work well for this dish, but linguine may hold the sauce slightly better. If you want a gluten-free option, try using gluten-free pasta or zucchini noodles. Always cook pasta al dente for the best texture."},{"name":"butter","advice":"Use unsalted butter to control the saltiness of the dish. For a richer flavor, consider using compound butter with herbs or garlic. If you're looking for a healthier option, you can substitute half of the butter with olive oil."},{"name":"garlic, minced","advice":"Fresh garlic is preferred for its robust flavor, but you can use garlic powder in a pinch (1/8 teaspoon per clove). To enhance the garlic flavor, lightly sauté it in the butter before adding other ingredients."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Extra virgin olive oil is the best choice for flavor. If you're running low, you can substitute with vegetable oil or avocado oil, but this may alter the taste slightly. Avoid using oil with a low smoke point."},{"name":"parsley, chopped","advice":"Fresh parsley adds brightness to the dish; however, you can substitute with basil or cilantro for a different flavor profile. If using dried parsley instead, use about 1 tablespoon, as dried herbs are more concentrated."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Adjust the salt based on your preference and dietary needs. Always start with a small amount and add more as needed. If you're watching your sodium intake, consider using a salt substitute or flavor enhancers like lemon juice."},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly cracked black pepper will provide the best flavor. For a milder taste, use white pepper instead, or omit it if you prefer. Adjust the amount to suit your personal heat tolerance."},{"name":"red pepper flakes (optional)","advice":"These add a nice kick to the dish. If you prefer a milder flavor, you can substitute with a dash of cayenne pepper or omit entirely. For extra heat, add more flakes or incorporate fresh chopped chili."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673acad4f103cfe5fb980715","name":"Savory Garlic Butter Shrimp Pasta","ingredients":[{"name":"shrimp, peeled and deveined","quantity":"1 pound","_id":"673acad8f103cfe5fb980724"},{"name":"spaghetti or linguine","quantity":"8 ounces","_id":"673acad8f103cfe5fb980725"},{"name":"butter","quantity":"4 tablespoons","_id":"673acad8f103cfe5fb980726"},{"name":"garlic, minced","quantity":"4 cloves","_id":"673acad8f103cfe5fb980727"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"1 tablespoon","_id":"673acad8f103cfe5fb980728"},{"name":"parsley, chopped","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"673acad8f103cfe5fb980729"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673acad8f103cfe5fb98072a"},{"name":"black pepper","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673acad8f103cfe5fb98072b"},{"name":"red pepper flakes (optional)","quantity":"1/2 teaspoon","_id":"673acad8f103cfe5fb98072c"}],"calories":450,"allergens":["Shellfish","Gluten"],"dietaryTags":["Seafood","Pasta","Easy"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":12.5,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":15,"tags":["Quick","Delicious","Comfort Food"],"quickTastyDescription":"A delightful and quick pasta dish featuring succulent shrimp tossed in a rich garlic butter sauce that’s perfect for weeknight dinners.","detailedCookingInstructions":["Cook the pasta according to package instructions.
