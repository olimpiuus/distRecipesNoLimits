Use a vegetable brush for better results. To cut them into wedges, first, cut the potato in half lengthwise, then lay each half flat and cut it into 3-4 wedges, depending on the size."},{"question":"What is the best way to season my potatoes?","answer":"Tossing the potatoes in a bowl with olive oil, dried herbs like rosemary and thyme, salt, and pepper ensures even seasoning. Make sure all wedges are well-coated for the best flavor."},{"question":"How can I ensure my potatoes are crispy?","answer":"To achieve crispy potatoes, make sure they are spread out in a single layer on the baking sheet. This allows the hot air to circulate around them. Also, preheating the oven is crucial for achieving that golden-brown texture."},{"question":"How can I tell if my chicken is heated through?","answer":"The best way to check if the chicken is heated through is to use a meat thermometer. The internal temperature should reach at least 165°F (74°C). If you don’t have a thermometer, cut into the chicken at the thickest part; the juices should run clear, not pink."},{"question":"What should I do if I don’t have dried rosemary or thyme?","answer":"If you don’t have dried rosemary or thyme, you can substitute them with other dried herbs like Italian seasoning, or use fresh herbs if available. Fresh herbs will have a stronger flavor, so you can use about three times the amount."},{"question":"Is it safe to handle cooked chicken?","answer":"Yes, but be sure to wash your hands before and after handling cooked chicken to avoid cross-contamination. Always use clean utensils and cutting boards when preparing and serving food."},{"question":"What can I serve with roasted chicken and herb potatoes?","answer":"Consider adding a side salad, steamed vegetables, or a grain like rice or quinoa to round out the meal.

You can enhance the flavor by adding a squeeze of lemon or a drizzle of your favorite sauce before serving. If you're looking for a healthier option, consider using rotisserie chicken without skin."},{"name":"potatoes","advice":"Choose starchy potatoes like Russets for fluffier insides, or waxy potatoes like Yukon Gold for creaminess. You can substitute potatoes with sweet potatoes for a different flavor and added nutrients. Make sure to wash and scrub them well before cutting to remove any dirt."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Extra virgin olive oil adds a rich flavor to the potatoes. If you need a substitution, canola oil or avocado oil works well but will have a milder taste. For added depth, consider infusing the olive oil with garlic or herbs before using it."},{"name":"dried rosemary","advice":"Dried rosemary can be quite strong; crush it between your fingers before adding to release more flavor. If you prefer fresh herbs, use about three times the amount since they are less concentrated. Thyme or oregano can be good substitutes if you're out of rosemary."},{"name":"dried thyme","advice":"Similar to rosemary, crush dried thyme to enhance its aroma. If using fresh thyme, replace with three times the amount.

If you're watching your sodium intake, consider using a salt substitute or simply reduce the amount.
