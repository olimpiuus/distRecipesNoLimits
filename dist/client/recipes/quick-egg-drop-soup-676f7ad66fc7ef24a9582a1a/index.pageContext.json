If you enjoy protein, consider adding shredded chicken or tofu to the soup for heartiness. A chilled, light-bodied white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc, complements the flavors beautifully. Alternatively, serve with a refreshing iced green tea or jasmine tea for a traditional touch.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the soup hot in a bowl, garnished with additional chopped green onions and a drizzle of sesame oil to enhance its aroma.

This practice, known as 'mise en place,' helps you stay organized and reduces stress while cooking."},{"question":"How do I know when my chicken broth is simmering?","answer":"A simmer is when small bubbles gently rise to the surface of the liquid. You should see some movement but not a rolling boil. This usually happens around medium heat."},{"question":"How do I properly beat eggs for the soup?","answer":"Crack the eggs into a bowl and use a fork or a whisk to beat them until the yolks and whites are fully combined and slightly frothy. This will help create the delicate ribbons in the soup."},{"question":"What if I don’t have cornstarch?","answer":"If you don't have cornstarch, you can use all-purpose flour, but you will need to use about double the amount. Mix it with water to create a slurry before adding it to the broth."},{"question":"How can I make sure my soup is seasoned properly?","answer":"Start by adding a small amount of salt and pepper, taste the soup after stirring in the soy sauce, and adjust as needed. Remember, you can always add more, but you can't take it out!"},{"question":"Can I add other ingredients to the soup?","answer":"Absolutely! Feel free to add vegetables like peas, carrots, or mushrooms, or proteins like shredded chicken or tofu for extra nutrition and flavor."},{"question":"How do I chop green onions safely?","answer":"Use a sharp knife and a cutting board. Slice off the root end, then cut the green onions into thin slices, using the whole stalk for flavor. Keep your fingers tucked in to avoid cuts!"},{"question":"What should I do if I accidentally overcook the eggs?","answer":"If the eggs become rubbery, try to gently stir them in right after adding to the broth to create smaller ribbons. Overcooked eggs are common but adding fresh ingredients can help balance the texture."},{"question":"How do I store leftover soup?","answer":"Let the soup cool to room temperature, then transfer it to an airtight container. You can keep it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or freeze it for longer storage."},{"question":"What are some kitchen safety tips I should know?","answer":"Always handle knives carefully, keep your cutting board steady, and never leave cooking food unattended. Also, remember to wash your hands before and after handling ingredients."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"chicken broth","advice":"For a richer flavor, use homemade chicken broth if available. Store-bought broth is fine, but choose low-sodium options to control salt levels. You can substitute with vegetable broth for a vegetarian version."},{"name":"eggs","advice":"Use fresh eggs for the best texture and flavor. For a fluffier soup, whisk the eggs vigorously before adding them to the broth. If you want to reduce cholesterol, you can substitute one of the eggs with egg whites."},{"name":"cornstarch","advice":"Cornstarch acts as a thickening agent. Make sure to mix it with cold water before adding it to the hot broth to avoid clumping. You can substitute with arrowroot powder or tapioca starch if needed."},{"name":"water","advice":"Use filtered water for a cleaner taste. If using cornstarch, ensure the water is cold to properly dissolve it before adding to the broth."},{"name":"green onions","advice":"Use both the white and green parts for a full flavor profile. If you don’t have green onions, you can substitute with chives or shallots, though they will change the flavor slightly."},{"name":"soy sauce","advice":"Soy sauce adds umami and saltiness. For a gluten-free option, use tamari. You can also try coconut aminos for a sweeter, less salty flavor."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Adjust salt to taste, especially since soy sauce already adds saltiness. If you are watching your sodium intake, consider using salt substitutes or simply omitting it."},{"name":"pepper","advice":"Freshly cracked black pepper will give the best flavor. For a kick, consider adding white pepper, which is traditionally used in Chinese cooking."}],"mealId":{"_id":"676f7ad66fc7ef24a9582a1a","name":"Quick Egg Drop Soup","ingredients":[{"name":"chicken broth","quantity":"4 cups","_id":"676f7ad86fc7ef24a9582a25"},{"name":"eggs","quantity":"2","_id":"676f7ad86fc7ef24a9582a26"},{"name":"cornstarch","quantity":"1 tablespoon","_id":"676f7ad86fc7ef24a9582a27"},{"name":"water","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"676f7ad86fc7ef24a9582a28"},{"name":"green onions","quantity":"2, chopped","_id":"676f7ad86fc7ef24a9582a29"},{"name":"soy sauce","quantity":"1 tablespoon","_id":"676f7ad86fc7ef24a9582a2a"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"to taste","_id":"676f7ad86fc7ef24a9582a2b"},{"name":"pepper","quantity":"to taste","_id":"676f7ad86fc7ef24a9582a2c"}],"calories":120,"allergens":[],"dietaryTags":["Gluten-Free","Low-Calorie"],"difficultyPercent":10,"price":8,"preparationTime":5,"cookingTime":10,"tags":["Quick","Easy","Comfort Food"],"quickTastyDescription":"A warm and comforting soup that comes together in minutes, featuring silky eggs and a savory broth.","detailedCookingInstructions":["In a medium saucepan, bring the chicken broth to a simmer over medium heat.","In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with water until smooth, then add it to the simmering broth to thicken slightly.","Beat the eggs in a bowl and slowly drizzle them into the hot broth while stirring gently to create egg ribbons.","Add the soy sauce, chopped green onions, salt, and pepper to taste.
