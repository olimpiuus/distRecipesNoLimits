Perfect for busy weeknights!","cookingSteps":[{"name":"Heat the Oil","description":"In a large pan or wok, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Make sure the oil is hot enough before adding other ingredients, as this will help to sear the meat and enhance the flavors."},{"name":"Sauté Garlic and Ginger","description":"Add 2 cloves of minced garlic and 1 teaspoon of grated ginger to the hot oil. Sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant, being careful not to burn them. This step is crucial as it builds the foundation of flavor for your stir-fry."},{"name":"Cook the Beef and Chicken","description":"Add 1 cup of thinly sliced beef and 1 cup of thinly sliced chicken breast to the pan. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring frequently, until the meats are browned and cooked through. Ensure the meat is in a single layer for even cooking."},{"name":"Add Vegetables","description":"Toss in 1 cup of sliced bell peppers and 1 cup of broccoli florets.

Enjoy your homemade beef and chicken stir-fry!"}],"pairings":{"pairings":"For a perfect pairing, serve the Beef and Chicken Stir-Fry with jasmine or basmati rice, which complements the savory flavors of the dish. Alternatively, you can use egg noodles or rice noodles for a different texture. To enhance the meal, consider adding a side of crispy spring rolls or egg rolls. For beverages, a light, crisp white wine like Sauvignon Blanc or a refreshing iced green tea would work beautifully, as they balance the richness of the stir-fry.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the stir-fry hot from the pan in a large bowl, allowing guests to help themselves. Garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions for added flavor and visual appeal. For a touch of heat, offer sriracha or chili oil on the side. Consider presenting the dish on a vibrant platter for family-style dining, or serve individual portions in colorful bowls for a more formal setting. To enhance the experience, include chopsticks alongside forks for a fun, interactive element.","dietary_considerations":"This stir-fry can easily be adapted for various dietary preferences. To make it gluten-free, substitute soy sauce with tamari or coconut aminos. For a lower-carb option, serve it over cauliflower rice or zucchini noodles instead of traditional rice or noodles. If you want to make it vegetarian or vegan, you can replace the beef and chicken with tofu or tempeh, ensuring it is marinated in a similar sauce for added flavor. Additionally, increase the vegetable content with options like snap peas, carrots, or mushrooms for a heartier dish."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I properly slice beef and chicken for stir-fry?","answer":"For even cooking, slice the beef and chicken thinly against the grain into strips. This makes the meat tender and allows it to cook quickly. If the meat is partially frozen, it will be easier to slice."},{"question":"What should I do if I don't have a wok?","answer":"No worries! A large frying pan or skillet works just fine for stir-frying. The key is to use a pan that allows for ample surface area to cook the ingredients quickly."},{"question":"How do I ensure my vegetables stay crisp in a stir-fry?","answer":"To keep your vegetables tender-crisp, avoid overcooking them. Stir-fry them for just a few minutes until they are bright and still firm. Adding them to the pan after the meat helps with this."},{"question":"What can I substitute for soy sauce?","answer":"If you need a substitute for soy sauce, try using tamari (gluten-free), coconut aminos, or a mixture of broth with a dash of vinegar. Adjust the quantity to taste."},{"question":"How can I add more flavor to my stir-fry?","answer":"Beyond soy sauce, you can enhance the flavor with additional spices like red pepper flakes, sesame oil, or even a splash of rice vinegar for acidity. Fresh herbs like cilantro or green onions can also brighten up the dish."},{"question":"Is it safe to cook raw chicken and beef together?","answer":"Yes, as long as you cook them thoroughly. Keep your raw meat separate from other ingredients until cooking, and ensure the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C) for chicken and 145°F (63°C) for beef."},{"question":"What type of oil should I use for stir-frying?","answer":"Vegetable oil is great, but you can also use oils with a high smoke point like canola, peanut, or grapeseed oil. Avoid olive oil as it has a lower smoke point and can burn."},{"question":"How do I know when my stir-fry is done?","answer":"Your stir-fry is done when the meat is no longer pink and the vegetables are bright in color and tender-crisp. The total cooking time should be around 10-15 minutes."},{"question":"Can I make this stir-fry ahead of time?","answer":"While stir-fry is best fresh, you can prep the ingredients ahead of time. Slice the meat and veggies and store them in the fridge. Cook them just before serving for the best texture."},{"question":"What can I serve with stir-fry?","answer":"Stir-fry is delicious on its own but is often served over rice or noodles. You can also pair it with a simple salad or steamed dumplings for a complete meal."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"beef (thinly sliced)","advice":"Choose a tender cut like sirloin or flank steak for best results. If you don't have fresh beef, you can substitute with pre-sliced beef from the store, or use pork or tofu for a different protein. Marinating the beef in soy sauce, a bit of cornstarch, and a splash of rice vinegar for 30 minutes can enhance its flavor and tenderness."},{"name":"chicken breast (thinly sliced)","advice":"Use boneless, skinless chicken breasts for a lean option. If you prefer dark meat, chicken thighs can be juicier and more flavorful. For a quick marinade, mix the chicken with a tablespoon of soy sauce and a teaspoon of sesame oil before cooking to enhance its flavor."},{"name":"bell peppers (sliced)","advice":"Use a mix of colored bell peppers (red, yellow, and green) for added sweetness and visual appeal. If bell peppers are not available, you can substitute with snap peas, zucchini, or carrots. For extra flavor, consider roasting the peppers briefly before adding them to the stir-fry."},{"name":"broccoli florets","advice":"Fresh broccoli is best, but you can also use frozen florets if you're short on time. Blanching the broccoli in hot water for a minute before stir-frying can help maintain its bright green color and crisp texture. As a substitute, you can use green beans or bok choy."},{"name":"soy sauce","advice":"Opt for low-sodium soy sauce if you're watching your salt intake. You can substitute with tamari for a gluten-free option or coconut aminos for a slightly sweeter flavor. To enhance the umami taste, consider adding a splash of oyster sauce or a teaspoon of fish sauce."},{"name":"garlic (minced)","advice":"Fresh garlic will provide the best flavor, but garlic powder can be used in a pinch (1/8 teaspoon for each clove). To mellow the flavor, sauté the garlic for a shorter time at lower heat, or roast the garlic before mincing it."},{"name":"ginger (grated)","advice":"Fresh ginger is preferred for its vibrant flavor; however, you can substitute ground ginger (1/4 teaspoon for 1 teaspoon of fresh). If you don't have ginger, you can skip it or use a dash of ground cinnamon for a different aromatic note."},{"name":"vegetable oil","advice":"Use oils with high smoke points like canola, peanut, or grapeseed oil for stir-frying. If you want extra flavor, try using sesame oil for part of the oil, but be careful not to use too much as it has a strong flavor."},{"name":"salt and pepper","advice":"Use sea salt or kosher salt for a more refined taste. Adjust the seasoning gradually as soy sauce already adds saltiness. Freshly cracked black pepper will enhance the dish more than pre-ground pepper. For a twist, consider adding a pinch of red pepper flakes for heat."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673ace304260099cc64fd6b2","name":"Beef and Chicken Stir-Fry","ingredients":[{"name":"beef (thinly sliced)","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673ace324260099cc64fd6c6"},{"name":"chicken breast (thinly sliced)","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673ace324260099cc64fd6c7"},{"name":"bell peppers (sliced)","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673ace324260099cc64fd6c8"},{"name":"broccoli florets","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673ace324260099cc64fd6c9"},{"name":"soy sauce","quantity":"3 tablespoons","_id":"673ace324260099cc64fd6ca"},{"name":"garlic (minced)","quantity":"2 cloves","_id":"673ace324260099cc64fd6cb"},{"name":"ginger (grated)","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"673ace324260099cc64fd6cc"},{"name":"vegetable oil","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"673ace324260099cc64fd6cd"},{"name":"salt and pepper","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673ace324260099cc64fd6ce"}],"calories":350,"allergens":["Soy"],"dietaryTags":["High Protein","Low Carb"],"difficultyPercent":30,"price":12.5,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":15,"tags":["Stir-Fry","Quick Meal","Healthy"],"quickTastyDescription":"A quick and flavorful stir-fry loaded with tender beef, juicy chicken, and colorful veggies, all tossed in a savory sauce.","detailedCookingInstructions":["Heat vegetable oil in a large pan or wok over medium-high heat.","Add minced garlic and grated ginger, sautéing for 30 seconds until fragrant.","Add the thinly sliced beef and chicken to the pan, cooking until browned (about 5-7 minutes).","Toss in the bell peppers and broccoli, stir-frying for another 3-4 minutes until vegetables are tender-crisp.","Pour in the soy sauce, stirring to coat all ingredients evenly.
