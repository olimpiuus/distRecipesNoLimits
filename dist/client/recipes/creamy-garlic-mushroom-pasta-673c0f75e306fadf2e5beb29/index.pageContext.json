Burnt garlic can taste bitter, so it's best to start over with fresh garlic."},{"question":"How can I tell when the mushrooms are done sautéing?","answer":"Mushrooms are done when they've released their moisture and turned golden brown. This usually takes about 5-7 minutes over medium heat."},{"question":"Can I use a different type of pasta?","answer":"Absolutely!

Toss the drained pasta with a little olive oil to help prevent sticking."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"pasta (fettuccine or spaghetti)","advice":"For a gluten-free option, use gluten-free pasta made from rice or lentils. Cook the pasta al dente to prevent it from becoming mushy when mixed with the sauce. You can also try using whole wheat pasta for a healthier alternative."},{"name":"mushrooms (sliced)","advice":"Use a mix of mushrooms, such as cremini, shiitake, or button mushrooms for added flavor and texture. Make sure to clean the mushrooms with a damp cloth instead of washing them under running water to avoid excess moisture."},{"name":"garlic (minced)","advice":"To enhance the garlic flavor, consider using roasted garlic instead of raw. You can roast whole garlic cloves in the oven until soft and caramelized for a sweeter taste. If you prefer a milder flavor, reduce the amount of garlic."},{"name":"heavy cream","advice":"For a lighter version, substitute half-and-half or a combination of milk and Greek yogurt.
