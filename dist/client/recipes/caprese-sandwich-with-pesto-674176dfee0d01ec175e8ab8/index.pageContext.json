To enhance flavor, consider briefly grilling or toasting the mozzarella before adding it to the sandwich."},{"name":"tomato","advice":"Choose a ripe, juicy tomato, such as a beefsteak or heirloom variety, for optimal flavor.

If fresh basil is not available, consider using fresh spinach or arugula as an alternative. For a flavor boost, gently bruise the basil leaves before adding them to release their natural oils."},{"name":"pesto sauce","advice":"Homemade pesto is preferable for freshness and flavor, but store-bought can be used in a pinch.
