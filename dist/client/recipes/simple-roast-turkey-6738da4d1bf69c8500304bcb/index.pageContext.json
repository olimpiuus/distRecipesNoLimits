If you can’t find a whole turkey, a bone-in turkey breast can be a good substitute, but adjust cooking times accordingly. Be sure to thaw frozen turkey in the fridge for several days before cooking."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Use kosher salt for a more even distribution and better flavor absorption. If using table salt, reduce the amount slightly as it is denser. Consider brining the turkey in a saltwater solution for a few hours or overnight for added moisture."},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly cracked black pepper has a stronger flavor than pre-ground pepper, so use a grinder if possible. For a different flavor profile, try incorporating white pepper or even smoked paprika for a slight kick."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Extra virgin olive oil will enhance the flavor of the turkey, but you can substitute with melted butter for a richer taste. If you’re looking for a healthier option, use a light olive oil."},{"name":"fresh rosemary","advice":"Fresh rosemary adds a fragrant, woodsy flavor. If you don’t have fresh, you can use 1 teaspoon of dried rosemary, but reduce the quantity as dried herbs are more potent.

You can substitute with shallots for a milder flavor, or use another aromatic like leeks."},{"name":"carrots, chopped","advice":"Carrots add sweetness and color.

If you don’t have celery, you can substitute with fennel for a slightly different taste or omit it altogether."},{"name":"chicken broth","advice":"Use low-sodium chicken broth to control the salt content. If you prefer a vegetarian option, vegetable broth will work, but keep in mind the flavor might be less rich."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"6738da4d1bf69c8500304bcb","name":"Simple Roast Turkey","ingredients":[{"name":"whole turkey","quantity":"12-14 lbs","_id":"6738da501bf69c8500304bd2"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"6738da501bf69c8500304bd3"},{"name":"black pepper","quantity":"2 tsp","_id":"6738da501bf69c8500304bd4"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"6738da501bf69c8500304bd5"},{"name":"fresh rosemary","quantity":"2 tbsp","_id":"6738da501bf69c8500304bd6"},{"name":"fresh thyme","quantity":"2 tbsp","_id":"6738da501bf69c8500304bd7"},{"name":"garlic cloves, minced","quantity":"6","_id":"6738da501bf69c8500304bd8"},{"name":"onion, quartered","quantity":"1","_id":"6738da501bf69c8500304bd9"},{"name":"carrots, chopped","quantity":"2","_id":"6738da501bf69c8500304bda"},{"name":"celery stalks, chopped","quantity":"2","_id":"6738da501bf69c8500304bdb"},{"name":"chicken broth","quantity":"4 cups","_id":"6738da501bf69c8500304bdc"}],"calories":300,"allergens":[],"dietaryTags":["Gluten-Free","Dairy-Free"],"difficultyPercent":30,"price":40,"preparationTime":30,"cookingTime":240,"tags":["Thanksgiving","Holiday","Main Course"],"quickTastyDescription":"A classic roast turkey that's juicy, flavorful, and perfect for any occasion.","detailedCookingInstructions":["Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C).","Remove the turkey giblets and pat the turkey dry with paper towels.","Rub the turkey inside and out with salt and black pepper.","Drizzle olive oil over the turkey and rub it in evenly.","Stuff the cavity with quartered onion, chopped carrots, chopped celery, minced garlic, and herbs.","Place the turkey breast-side up on a rack in a roasting pan.","Add chicken broth to the bottom of the pan to keep the turkey moist during cooking.","Roast the turkey in the preheated oven, basting every 30 minutes, until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) in the thickest part of the thigh, about 3 to 4 hours.","Let the turkey rest for at least 20 minutes before carving."],"createdByModel":"4o","detailedName":"Easy Roast Turkey","baseMeal":"Turkey","modifiersForBase":"Roasted with herbs and vegetables","imageUrl":"/images/simple-roast-turkey-6738da4d1bf69c8500304bcf.webp","image":"6738da4d1bf69c8500304bcf","servings":12,"cuisine":["American"],"course":["Main Course","Dinner"],"dateCreated":"2024-11-16T17:45:52.660Z","createdAt":"2024-11-16T17:45:52.661Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-19T05:35:47.958Z","__v":0,"mealUrl":"simple-roast-turkey-6738da4d1bf69c8500304bcb"},"__v":0}}
