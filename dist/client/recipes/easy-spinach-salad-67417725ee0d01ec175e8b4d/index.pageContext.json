After rinsing, pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel or use a salad spinner to remove excess water."},{"question":"How do I cut a cucumber for a salad?","answer":"Start by washing the cucumber under cold water. Then, cut off both ends. You can slice it in half lengthwise and then cut it into half-moons or dice it into small cubes, depending on your preference."},{"question":"How do I crumble feta cheese?","answer":"To crumble feta cheese, simply use your fingers to break it into small pieces. If the feta is too firm, you can use a fork to help break it apart."},{"question":"What is the best way to make a salad dressing?","answer":"A simple way to make a salad dressing is to whisk together oil and vinegar. For the spinach salad, combine 3 tablespoons of olive oil with 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar in a small bowl, then add salt and pepper to taste.

You can always add more seasoning to suit your taste."},{"question":"How do I toss a salad without making a mess?","answer":"To toss a salad gently, use two large serving spoons or your hands. Scoop from the bottom and lift the ingredients up and over each other, being careful not to break the leaves or ingredients."},{"question":"Can I make this salad ahead of time?","answer":"While you can prepare the individual ingredients ahead of time, it’s best to assemble the salad and add the dressing just before serving to keep the spinach fresh and crisp."},{"question":"What other ingredients can I add to this salad?","answer":"Feel free to customize your salad!

If fresh spinach is not available, you can substitute with baby kale or arugula for a different flavor. Always wash the spinach thoroughly to remove any grit."},{"name":"cherry tomatoes","advice":"Select firm, bright red cherry tomatoes for the best flavor. If you cannot find cherry tomatoes, you can use grape tomatoes or even diced regular tomatoes, but the latter will add more moisture. Roasting the tomatoes before adding them to the salad can enhance their sweetness."},{"name":"cucumber","advice":"Use a fresh cucumber with a firm skin.

For a twist, try pickling thin slices of cucumber for a tangy addition."},{"name":"feta cheese","advice":"Opt for a block of feta cheese for crumbling, as it has a firmer texture than pre-crumbled varieties. If you want a dairy-free option, try using vegan feta made from almonds or tofu. For a bolder flavor, consider adding crumbled blue cheese instead."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Use high-quality extra virgin olive oil for the best flavor. If you're looking for a lighter option, you can replace part of the olive oil with Greek yogurt to create a creamy dressing. For added complexity, try infusing the olive oil with herbs like rosemary or garlic."},{"name":"balsamic vinegar","advice":"Choose a good quality aged balsamic vinegar for a richer, sweeter flavor.

Start with a small amount and adjust to your taste preference.
