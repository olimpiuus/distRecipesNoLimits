Accompany the dish with a side of extra BBQ sauce in a small bowl for dipping. Present with a selection of pickles or jalapeños on the side for guests who enjoy a bit of tang or heat. For a casual gathering, consider serving the chicken in a sandwich format using slider buns, adding crisp lettuce and sliced tomatoes.","dietary_considerations":"This dish is naturally gluten-free and dairy-free. For a low-carb option, serve the chicken drumsticks with a side of grilled vegetables or a fresh garden salad instead of traditional sides.

Homemade BBQ sauce can add a personal touch and allow you to customize the flavors to your liking."},{"question":"What if I don’t have garlic powder or onion powder?","answer":"You can use fresh garlic and onion instead.

Just make sure your slow cooker is large enough to hold everything, and the cooking time may need to be adjusted slightly."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"chicken drumsticks","advice":"Choose drumsticks with skin on for extra flavor and moisture. If you prefer a healthier option, skinless drumsticks can be used but may result in slightly less juicy chicken. You can substitute with chicken thighs if desired; just adjust the cooking time slightly as thighs may take longer to cook."},{"name":"bbq sauce","advice":"Select a BBQ sauce that matches your taste preferences; you can use sweet, tangy, or spicy varieties. For a homemade option, mix ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, and spices. You can also substitute with teriyaki sauce or a homemade marinade for a different flavor profile."},{"name":"garlic powder","advice":"Garlic powder provides a concentrated flavor, but you can substitute it with fresh minced garlic (about 2-3 cloves) if you prefer a fresher taste. Be careful not to use too much fresh garlic, as it can overpower the dish."},{"name":"onion powder","advice":"Onion powder adds depth to the flavor; if you don’t have it, you can use fresh onions (about 1 small onion, finely chopped) or shallots for a milder taste. Alternatively, shallot powder can be used for a similar flavor."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Salt enhances all the flavors in the dish. If you're watching your sodium intake, consider using low-sodium salt or a salt substitute. Taste the BBQ sauce before adding salt as some sauces can already be quite salty."},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly ground black pepper has a more robust flavor than pre-ground, so if possible, use whole peppercorns and grind them just before adding. You can substitute with white pepper for a milder taste, or omit it if you prefer a milder flavor."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"674022976da16aa2e977484d","name":"Slow Cooker BBQ Chicken Drumsticks","ingredients":[{"name":"chicken drumsticks","quantity":"2 pounds","_id":"674022996da16aa2e977485b"},{"name":"bbq sauce","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"674022996da16aa2e977485c"},{"name":"garlic powder","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"674022996da16aa2e977485d"},{"name":"onion powder","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"674022996da16aa2e977485e"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"674022996da16aa2e977485f"},{"name":"black pepper","quantity":"1/2 teaspoon","_id":"674022996da16aa2e9774860"}],"calories":350,"allergens":["None"],"dietaryTags":["Gluten-Free","Dairy-Free","High Protein"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":10,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":240,"tags":["Slow Cooker","Easy","BBQ","Chicken"],"quickTastyDescription":"Tender chicken drumsticks coated in rich BBQ sauce, perfectly cooked in a slow cooker for a hassle-free meal.","detailedCookingInstructions":["Place the chicken drumsticks in the slow cooker.","In a bowl, mix the BBQ sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper.","Pour the BBQ sauce mixture over the chicken, ensuring they are well coated.","Cover the slow cooker and cook on low for 4 hours or high for 2 hours.","Once cooked, serve the chicken with extra BBQ sauce if desired."],"createdByModel":"4o","detailedName":"Slow Cooker BBQ Chicken Drumsticks","baseMeal":"Chicken Drumsticks","modifiersForBase":"BBQ Sauce and Spices","imageUrl":"/images/slow-cooker-bbq-chicken-drumsticks-674022976da16aa2e9774853.webp","image":"674022976da16aa2e9774853","servings":4,"cuisine":["American"],"course":["Main Course"],"dateCreated":"2024-11-22T06:20:09.281Z","createdAt":"2024-11-22T06:20:09.282Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-23T06:06:14.837Z","__v":0,"mealUrl":"slow-cooker-bbq-chicken-drumsticks-674022976da16aa2e977484d"},"__v":0}}
