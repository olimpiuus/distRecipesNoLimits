Cut them into even 1-inch cubes to ensure they cook evenly. This step is crucial as uneven sizes can lead to some pieces being undercooked while others are overcooked."},{"name":"Cook the Sweet Potatoes","description":"Place the cubed sweet potatoes in a large pot and cover them with cold water. This helps them cook evenly from the start. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and let simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are fork-tender. You can check doneness by poking a cube with a fork; it should slide in easily."},{"name":"Drain and Return to Pot","description":"Once the sweet potatoes are tender, carefully drain them in a colander. Return the drained sweet potatoes to the pot. This step allows any excess moisture to evaporate, preventing your mash from becoming watery."},{"name":"Add Ingredients","description":"Add the butter, milk, salt, and black pepper to the pot. The butter should be at room temperature so it melts easily into the sweet potatoes. If you prefer a richer taste, consider using whole milk or even cream."},{"name":"Mash the Sweet Potatoes","description":"Use a potato masher, fork, or a hand mixer to mash the sweet potatoes until they are smooth and creamy.
