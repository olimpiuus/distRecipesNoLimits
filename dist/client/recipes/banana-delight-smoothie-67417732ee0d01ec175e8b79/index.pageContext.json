Alternatively, you can use a ripe banana from the grocery store or let it sit at room temperature for a few days to ripen."},{"question":"Can I use other types of milk?","answer":"Absolutely! You can substitute cow's milk with almond milk, soy milk, oat milk, or any other milk alternative you prefer. Each type will give a slightly different flavor and texture to your smoothie."},{"question":"How can I make my smoothie thicker?","answer":"To make your smoothie thicker, you can add more banana, use frozen banana slices instead of fresh, or add Greek yogurt. A little extra peanut butter can also help thicken it up."},{"question":"Is it safe to use a blender?","answer":"Yes, using a blender is safe as long as you follow basic safety precautions. Always ensure the lid is securely on before blending, and avoid putting your fingers near the blades. If you're new to using a blender, start at a low speed and gradually increase it."},{"question":"How do I clean my blender easily?","answer":"To clean your blender, fill it halfway with warm water and add a drop of dish soap. Blend on high for 30 seconds, then rinse thoroughly with water. This helps remove any residue without scrubbing."},{"question":"What if I don't have honey?","answer":"If you don't have honey, you can use maple syrup, agave nectar, or simply skip it altogether if you prefer a less sweet smoothie.

Feel free to add other fruits like strawberries, blueberries, or mangoes for added flavor and nutrition. Just adjust the amount of liquid if you add a lot of additional fruit."},{"question":"How long can I store my smoothie?","answer":"It's best to drink your smoothie fresh, but if you need to store it, keep it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 24 hours.

If you don't have ripe bananas, you can speed up the ripening process by placing them in a paper bag with an apple for a day or two. Alternatively, frozen bananas can be used for a thicker texture."},{"name":"milk (or almond milk)","advice":"You can substitute dairy milk with any plant-based milk such as oat, soy, or coconut milk depending on your dietary preferences. For a creamier texture, opt for full-fat coconut milk.

If you want a thicker consistency, use frozen fruit instead of ice cubes. You can also blend the smoothie without ice if you prefer a creamier texture."},{"name":"peanut butter (optional)","advice":"Peanut butter adds richness and protein; if you're looking for alternatives, almond butter or cashew butter work well too.
