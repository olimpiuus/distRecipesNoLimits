Aim for bite-sized pieces, generally about 1-inch in size. Use a sharp knife to make clean cuts, and remember to wash your vegetables thoroughly before prepping!"},{"question":"How do I know when the oil is hot enough for stir-frying?","answer":"A good indicator that your oil is hot enough is to drop a small piece of food into the pan. If it sizzles immediately, the oil is ready. Alternatively, you can use a wooden spoon; if bubbles form around it when you dip it into the oil, it’s hot enough."},{"question":"What if I don't have fresh garlic or ginger?","answer":"You can use garlic powder and ground ginger as substitutes.
