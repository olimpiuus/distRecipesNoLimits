Add in 4 minced garlic cloves, 2 teaspoons of salt, and 1 teaspoon of black pepper. Mix until the ingredients are well combined. This herb butter will add incredible flavor to your turkey."},{"name":"Prepare the Turkey","description":"Take your 12-14 lbs turkey and pat it dry with paper towels. This step is crucial as it helps the skin to crisp up nicely when roasting. Carefully loosen the skin over the breast and thighs by gently inserting your fingers between the skin and the meat."},{"name":"Apply the Herb Butter","description":"Spread the prepared herb butter mixture generously under the skin of the turkey, making sure to cover the breast and thighs evenly. Then, rub the remaining butter all over the outside of the turkey for a beautiful, flavorful crust."},{"name":"Stuff the Cavity","description":"For added flavor, stuff the cavity of the turkey with quartered onion, 2 chopped carrots, and 2 chopped celery stalks. This will also help to keep the turkey moist during roasting."},{"name":"Prepare the Roasting Pan","description":"Place the turkey breast side up on a rack in a roasting pan. Pour 2 cups of chicken broth into the bottom of the pan. This will create steam and keep the turkey moist while it roasts."},{"name":"Roast the Turkey","description":"Roast the turkey in the preheated oven, basting every 30 minutes with the pan juices. Continue roasting until the internal temperature of the turkey reaches 165°F (74°C), which usually takes about 3 hours for a turkey of this size."},{"name":"Rest the Turkey","description":"Once the turkey is done roasting, remove it from the oven and let it rest for 20-30 minutes before carving. This resting period allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, resulting in a juicier turkey."}],"pairings":{"pairings":"Pair this Thanksgiving turkey with traditional sides such as creamy mashed potatoes, green bean casserole, or roasted Brussels sprouts. For beverages, consider serving a crisp white wine like Chardonnay or a light red like Pinot Noir. A homemade cranberry sauce adds a delightful tartness that complements the rich flavors of the turkey.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the turkey on a large, decorative platter garnished with fresh herbs like rosemary and thyme for visual appeal. Accompany it with a selection of colorful sides arranged attractively around the turkey. For a festive touch, consider adding seasonal fruits like pomegranates or figs. Carve the turkey at the table to enhance the experience, allowing guests to see the beautifully roasted bird and enjoy the aroma as it is served.","dietary_considerations":"This dish is suitable for omnivores and can be made gluten-free by ensuring the chicken broth is gluten-free. For a dairy-free option, substitute the butter with a vegan alternative, such as olive oil or a plant-based butter. Keep in mind that the stuffing can be adapted with gluten-free bread or grains for those with gluten sensitivities."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I choose the right turkey size for my gathering?","answer":"A general rule is to plan for about 1 to 1.5 pounds of turkey per person. For a gathering of 8-10 people, a 12-14 pound turkey is usually sufficient."},{"question":"How do I properly thaw a frozen turkey?","answer":"The best way to thaw a turkey is in the refrigerator. Allow 24 hours for every 4-5 pounds. For a quicker method, submerge the turkey in cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes."},{"question":"What does it mean to loosen the skin on the turkey?","answer":"Loosening the skin allows you to spread the herb butter directly onto the meat, which helps to flavor the turkey and keep it moist during cooking. Carefully slide your fingers between the skin and the meat without tearing the skin."},{"question":"How can I tell when the turkey is fully cooked?","answer":"The turkey is done when it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C) in the thickest part of the breast and thigh. Use a meat thermometer for accuracy."},{"question":"What should I do if I don’t have fresh herbs?","answer":"Dried herbs can be used instead of fresh herbs, but use less—about 1 teaspoon of dried herbs for every tablespoon of fresh herbs."},{"question":"What is basting and why is it important?","answer":"Basting involves spooning the pan juices over the turkey every 30 minutes. This helps keep the meat moist and adds flavor to the skin."},{"question":"How do I carve the turkey once it's done?","answer":"Let the turkey rest for 20-30 minutes before carving. Start by removing the legs and thighs, then slice the breast meat against the grain for tender pieces."},{"question":"Can I prepare the herb butter in advance?","answer":"Yes! You can make the herb butter up to a day ahead. Just keep it covered in the refrigerator until you're ready to use it."},{"question":"What should I do with leftover turkey?","answer":"Leftover turkey can be refrigerated for 3-4 days. Use it in sandwiches, salads, soups, or casseroles for quick meals."},{"question":"How do I safely handle raw turkey to prevent contamination?","answer":"Always wash your hands, utensils, and surfaces after handling raw turkey. Avoid rinsing the turkey as it can spread bacteria; cooking it properly will kill any germs."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"turkey (12-14 lbs)","advice":"Choose a fresh or fully thawed turkey for the best texture and flavor. If you can't find a 12-14 lbs turkey, a slightly larger or smaller bird is acceptable; just adjust cooking time accordingly. Consider brining the turkey overnight for extra moisture."},{"name":"unsalted butter","advice":"Use unsalted butter to control the salt content of your dish. If you need a dairy-free option, try using olive oil or a plant-based butter alternative, although the flavor will be slightly different."},{"name":"fresh rosemary, chopped","advice":"Fresh rosemary has a strong flavor; use it sparingly if you're unsure. If you don't have fresh, you can substitute with dried rosemary at a 1:3 ratio (1 tablespoon dried for 3 tablespoons fresh). Consider adding a pinch of lemon zest for brightness."},{"name":"fresh sage, chopped","advice":"Sage pairs beautifully with turkey; if fresh is unavailable, use dried sage (1 tablespoon dried for 3 tablespoons fresh). Be cautious with dried sage as its flavor is more concentrated."},{"name":"fresh thyme, chopped","advice":"Thyme adds a lovely earthiness to the dish. If you prefer, you can substitute it with oregano or marjoram, but the flavor profile will shift slightly."},{"name":"garlic, minced","advice":"Garlic enhances the overall flavor; you can roast the garlic cloves beforehand for a milder, sweeter taste. If you don't have fresh garlic, garlic powder can be used (1/8 teaspoon = 1 clove), but it won't provide the same depth."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Kosher salt is ideal for seasoning the turkey as it dissolves well and enhances flavor. If using table salt, reduce the amount slightly as it is more concentrated. For a unique flavor, consider using smoked salt."},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly cracked black pepper provides the best flavor. If you want a bit of heat, try adding some cayenne pepper or crushed red pepper flakes to the mix."},{"name":"onion, quartered","advice":"Onions add moisture and flavor; you can use yellow, white, or even red onions. For a sweeter flavor, consider using shallots or even apples."},{"name":"carrots, chopped","advice":"Carrots add sweetness and color. You can substitute with parsnips for a different flavor profile, or use a mix of root vegetables such as turnips or sweet potatoes."},{"name":"celery stalks, chopped","advice":"Celery adds crunch and flavor. If you're not a fan, you can use fennel for a unique taste or omit it entirely and add more carrots or onions instead."},{"name":"chicken broth","advice":"Use low-sodium chicken broth to control salt levels. If you're in a pinch, vegetable broth or homemade stock can be used. For a richer flavor, consider adding a splash of white wine to the broth."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"_id":"67416f47e52d259d679729d2","name":"Thanksgiving Turkey with Herb Butter","ingredients":[{"name":"turkey (12-14 lbs)","quantity":"1","_id":"67416f4ee52d259d679729db"},{"name":"unsalted butter","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"67416f4ee52d259d679729dc"},{"name":"fresh rosemary, chopped","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"67416f4ee52d259d679729dd"},{"name":"fresh sage, chopped","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"67416f4ee52d259d679729de"},{"name":"fresh thyme, chopped","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"67416f4ee52d259d679729df"},{"name":"garlic, minced","quantity":"4 cloves","_id":"67416f4ee52d259d679729e0"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"2 teaspoons","_id":"67416f4ee52d259d679729e1"},{"name":"black pepper","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"67416f4ee52d259d679729e2"},{"name":"onion, quartered","quantity":"1","_id":"67416f4ee52d259d679729e3"},{"name":"carrots, chopped","quantity":"2","_id":"67416f4ee52d259d679729e4"},{"name":"celery stalks, chopped","quantity":"2","_id":"67416f4ee52d259d679729e5"},{"name":"chicken broth","quantity":"2 cups","_id":"67416f4ee52d259d679729e6"}],"calories":400,"allergens":["Dairy"],"dietaryTags":["Gluten-Free","Dairy"],"difficultyPercent":25,"price":75,"preparationTime":30,"cookingTime":180,"tags":["Thanksgiving","Turkey","Easy","Herb Butter"],"quickTastyDescription":"A perfectly roasted turkey infused with a rich herb butter, making every bite juicy and flavorful.","detailedCookingInstructions":["Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C).","In a bowl, mix together the softened butter, chopped herbs, minced garlic, salt, and pepper until well combined.","Pat the turkey dry with paper towels and carefully loosen the skin on the breast and thighs.","Spread the herb butter mixture under the skin and over the outside of the turkey, ensuring even coverage.","Stuff the cavity with quartered onion, chopped carrots, and celery for added flavor.","Place the turkey breast side up on a rack in a roasting pan and pour chicken broth into the bottom of the pan.","Roast the turkey in the preheated oven, basting every 30 minutes with the pan juices, until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C), about 3 hours.","Let the turkey rest for 20-30 minutes before carving and serving."],"createdByModel":"4o","detailedName":"Herb Butter Roasted Thanksgiving Turkey","baseMeal":"Turkey","modifiersForBase":"with Herb Butter","imageUrl":"/images/thanksgiving-turkey-with-herb-butter-67416f47e52d259d679729d6.webp","image":"67416f47e52d259d679729d6","servings":12,"cuisine":["American"],"course":["Main Course"],"SEOLongkeywords":["Thanksgiving turkey","easy turkey recipe","herb butter turkey","holiday turkey","roasted turkey recipe"],"dateCreated":"2024-11-23T05:59:42.021Z","createdAt":"2024-11-23T05:59:42.024Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-23T06:06:15.019Z","__v":0,"mealUrl":"thanksgiving-turkey-with-herb-butter-67416f47e52d259d679729d2"},"__v":0}}
