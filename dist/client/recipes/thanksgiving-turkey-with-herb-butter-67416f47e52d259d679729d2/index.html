If you can&#x27;t find a 12-14 lbs turkey, a slightly larger or smaller bird is acceptable; just adjust cooking time accordingly. Consider brining the turkey overnight for extra moisture.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">unsalted butter</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Use unsalted butter to control the salt content of your dish. If you need a dairy-free option, try using olive oil or a plant-based butter alternative, although the flavor will be slightly different.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">fresh rosemary, chopped</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Fresh rosemary has a strong flavor; use it sparingly if you&#x27;re unsure. If you don&#x27;t have fresh, you can substitute with dried rosemary at a 1:3 ratio (1 tablespoon dried for 3 tablespoons fresh). Consider adding a pinch of lemon zest for brightness.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">fresh sage, chopped</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Sage pairs beautifully with turkey; if fresh is unavailable, use dried sage (1 tablespoon dried for 3 tablespoons fresh). Be cautious with dried sage as its flavor is more concentrated.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">fresh thyme, chopped</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Thyme adds a lovely earthiness to the dish. If you prefer, you can substitute it with oregano or marjoram, but the flavor profile will shift slightly.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">garlic, minced</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Garlic enhances the overall flavor; you can roast the garlic cloves beforehand for a milder, sweeter taste. If you don&#x27;t have fresh garlic, garlic powder can be used (1/8 teaspoon = 1 clove), but it won&#x27;t provide the same depth.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">salt</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Kosher salt is ideal for seasoning the turkey as it dissolves well and enhances flavor. If using table salt, reduce the amount slightly as it is more concentrated. For a unique flavor, consider using smoked salt.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">black pepper</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Freshly cracked black pepper provides the best flavor. If you want a bit of heat, try adding some cayenne pepper or crushed red pepper flakes to the mix.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">onion, quartered</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Onions add moisture and flavor; you can use yellow, white, or even red onions. For a sweeter flavor, consider using shallots or even apples.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">carrots, chopped</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Carrots add sweetness and color. You can substitute with parsnips for a different flavor profile, or use a mix of root vegetables such as turnips or sweet potatoes.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">celery stalks, chopped</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Celery adds crunch and flavor.
