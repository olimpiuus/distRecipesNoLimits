This removes excess starch and prevents it from becoming sticky. Cook the rice with 2 cups of water in a rice cooker or on the stove (bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook for about 18-20 minutes). Let it sit covered for another 10 minutes before fluffing with a fork."},{"question":"What is the best way to slice chicken breast?","answer":"For even cooking, slice the chicken breast against the grain into thin strips. This helps keep the meat tender. You can also slightly freeze the chicken for about 15-20 minutes to make slicing easier."},{"question":"How do I blanch spinach and why is it necessary?","answer":"Blanching spinach involves cooking it briefly in boiling water (about 1-2 minutes) and then immediately transferring it to ice water to stop the cooking process. This preserves the vibrant color and nutrients. Afterward, drain and squeeze out excess water."},{"question":"What is gochujang and how spicy is it?","answer":"Gochujang is a Korean fermented chili paste that adds a spicy, slightly sweet flavor to dishes. It's not extremely spicy, but its heat can vary by brand. Start with a smaller amount and adjust according to your taste."},{"question":"Can I use other vegetables instead of zucchini and carrots?","answer":"Absolutely! Feel free to use any vegetables you like or have on hand, such as bell peppers, mushrooms, or bean sprouts. Just ensure they are cut into similar-sized pieces for even cooking."},{"question":"How do I fry an egg sunny-side up?","answer":"Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add a little oil or butter. Crack the egg gently into the pan without breaking the yolk. Cook for about 2-3 minutes until the whites are set but the yolk remains runny. You can cover the pan with a lid to help cook the top without flipping."},{"question":"What if I don't have sesame oil?","answer":"If you don't have sesame oil, you can substitute with olive oil or another neutral oil for cooking. However, for flavor, try adding a sprinkle of sesame seeds when serving to replicate some of the nutty taste."},{"question":"How should I serve Bibimbap?","answer":"Serve Bibimbap in individual bowls, layering the cooked rice first, then the sautéed chicken, vegetables, and blanched spinach. Top with a fried egg, drizzle with gochujang, and finish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions. Encourage everyone to mix it up before eating!"},{"question":"How do I ensure food safety while cooking?","answer":"Always wash your hands before and after handling raw chicken. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat and vegetables to prevent cross-contamination. Cook chicken until it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C)."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"cooked rice","advice":"Use short-grain rice for a stickier texture, typical in Korean dishes. If you don't have rice, quinoa or cauliflower rice can be good substitutes. For flavor enhancement, use broth instead of water when cooking the rice."},{"name":"chicken breast","advice":"For a juicier result, consider marinating the chicken for longer than 5 minutes. If you're looking for a more flavorful option, you can substitute with chicken thighs or even tofu for a vegetarian version."},{"name":"soy sauce","advice":"Use low-sodium soy sauce to control the saltiness. If you want a gluten-free option, tamari or coconut aminos are great substitutes. Adding a bit of sugar or honey can enhance the umami flavor."},{"name":"sesame oil","advice":"Opt for toasted sesame oil for a deeper flavor. If unavailable, you can substitute with other oils like olive oil, though it won't have the same nutty aroma.

If you want a different texture, consider using bell peppers or daikon radish as alternatives."},{"name":"zucchini","advice":"Make sure to not overcook the zucchini to retain its crunch. If you want to add more flavors, you can sprinkle some salt and let it sit for a few minutes before cooking.

If you’re looking for a vegan option, substitute with scrambled tofu or avocado."},{"name":"gochujang (korean chili paste)","advice":"If you can’t find gochujang, you can use Sriracha mixed with a little miso paste as a substitute. Adjust the amount based on your spice tolerance; adding a touch of honey can balance the heat."},{"name":"sesame seeds","advice":"Toasting the sesame seeds before using them can enhance their flavor significantly. If you don’t have sesame seeds, you can use chopped nuts like peanuts or almonds for a different crunch."},{"name":"green onions","advice":"Use both the white and green parts for added flavor.
