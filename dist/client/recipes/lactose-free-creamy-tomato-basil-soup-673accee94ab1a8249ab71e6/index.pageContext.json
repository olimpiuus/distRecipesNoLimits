Fresh garlic adds a wonderful flavor to your dishes!"},{"question":"How do I know when the olive oil is hot enough to add ingredients?","answer":"You can test if the olive oil is hot enough by adding a small piece of garlic. If it sizzles immediately, the oil is ready. This helps prevent the oil from smoking and burning."},{"question":"How do I blend the soup without a fancy blender?","answer":"An immersion blender is perfect for blending soups directly in the pot. If you don’t have one, you can carefully transfer the soup in batches to a regular blender. Just be cautious with hot liquids!"},{"question":"What can I use instead of fresh basil if I don’t have any?","answer":"If you don’t have fresh basil, dried basil can be used as a substitute.

When blending hot soup, allow it to cool slightly to avoid splattering.

You can add vegetables like onions, carrots, or bell peppers for more flavor and nutrition.

Look for brands with no added sugars or preservatives for a cleaner flavor. If you prefer a fresher taste, you can use fresh tomatoes (about 2 pounds), just peel and chop them before adding."},{"name":"vegetable broth","advice":"Choose a low-sodium vegetable broth to control the saltiness of your soup. If you don’t have vegetable broth, you can substitute it with water mixed with bouillon cubes or homemade broth for a richer flavor. For a twist, use mushroom broth to add depth."},{"name":"coconut milk (canned)","advice":"Full-fat coconut milk gives a creamier texture; light coconut milk can be used for fewer calories but may affect creaminess.

For extra flavor, consider infusing the oil with herbs or garlic before adding it to the pot."},{"name":"garlic cloves, minced","advice":"Fresh garlic is more potent than pre-minced; adjust the amount according to your taste. If you love garlic, consider roasting it first for a sweeter flavor. For a milder garlic taste, use garlic powder instead, about 1/2 teaspoon for each clove."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Start with a small amount, especially if using broth that contains salt, and adjust to taste. Consider using sea salt or kosher salt for a cleaner flavor. For an alternative, use lemon juice or a splash of vinegar to enhance the overall taste without adding more salt."},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly ground black pepper adds more flavor than pre-ground.
