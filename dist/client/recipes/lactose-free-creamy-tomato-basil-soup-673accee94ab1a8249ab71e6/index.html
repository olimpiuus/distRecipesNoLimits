Look for brands with no added sugars or preservatives for a cleaner flavor. If you prefer a fresher taste, you can use fresh tomatoes (about 2 pounds), just peel and chop them before adding.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">vegetable broth</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Choose a low-sodium vegetable broth to control the saltiness of your soup. If you don’t have vegetable broth, you can substitute it with water mixed with bouillon cubes or homemade broth for a richer flavor. For a twist, use mushroom broth to add depth.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">coconut milk (canned)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Full-fat coconut milk gives a creamier texture; light coconut milk can be used for fewer calories but may affect creaminess. If you prefer a different flavor, consider using cashew cream or almond milk, but adjust the seasoning as these are less rich.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">fresh basil leaves</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Fresh basil is essential for brightness; if unavailable, use 1-2 teaspoons of dried basil. To enhance flavor, you can chiffonade the basil leaves (stack, roll, and slice finely) before adding them to the soup. Adding basil towards the end of cooking preserves its fresh flavor.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">olive oil</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Extra virgin olive oil is best for flavor; however, you can substitute with avocado oil or grapeseed oil for a higher smoke point. For extra flavor, consider infusing the oil with herbs or garlic before adding it to the pot.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">garlic cloves, minced</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Fresh garlic is more potent than pre-minced; adjust the amount according to your taste. If you love garlic, consider roasting it first for a sweeter flavor. For a milder garlic taste, use garlic powder instead, about 1/2 teaspoon for each clove.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">salt</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Start with a small amount, especially if using broth that contains salt, and adjust to taste. Consider using sea salt or kosher salt for a cleaner flavor. For an alternative, use lemon juice or a splash of vinegar to enhance the overall taste without adding more salt.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">black pepper</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Freshly ground black pepper adds more flavor than pre-ground. If you want a bit of heat, try adding crushed red pepper flakes or a dash of cayenne pepper for a kick.</p></div></div></section><section class="mb-12 text-justify"><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8 text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500 to-orange-600">Cooking Steps</h2><ul class="space-y-6"><li id="coocking-step-heat-the-olive-oil" class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-orange-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-800">Step <!-- -->1<!-- -->: <span class="text-orange-600">Heat the Olive Oil</span></h3><div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span>In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat.
