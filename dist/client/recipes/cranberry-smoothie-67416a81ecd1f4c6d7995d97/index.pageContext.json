Just keep in mind that flavored yogurts may add extra sugar."},{"question":"What if I don't have almond milk?","answer":"You can substitute almond milk with any milk of your choice, such as cow's milk, soy milk, coconut milk, or oat milk.

Frozen cranberries are a great alternative and can be used directly from the freezer without thawing. If you prefer a sweeter smoothie, consider adding a little extra banana or honey, as cranberries are quite tart."},{"name":"banana","advice":"Choose a ripe banana for optimal sweetness and creaminess. If you have overripe bananas, they can be frozen ahead of time for use in smoothies. For a lower-sugar option, you can substitute with half an avocado for creaminess without the sweetness."},{"name":"greek yogurt","advice":"Opt for plain Greek yogurt for a tangy flavor and a boost of protein.
