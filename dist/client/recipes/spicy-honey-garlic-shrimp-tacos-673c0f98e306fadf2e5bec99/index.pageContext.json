For non-alcoholic options, a zesty limeade or a cucumber-mint mocktail complements the heat of the shrimp. Adding a side of black beans or a corn salad provides a hearty balance to the meal.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the tacos on a colorful platter, garnished with extra cilantro and lime wedges for added visual appeal. Consider serving alongside a fresh salsa or pico de gallo to enhance the flavors. For a casual gathering, set up a taco bar where guests can customize their tacos with toppings like diced tomatoes, jalapeños, or a drizzle of spicy mayo for an extra kick.","dietary_considerations":"This dish can be made gluten-free by using corn tortillas instead of flour. To accommodate dairy-free diets, simply avoid any sour cream or cheese toppings. For a low-carb version, consider using lettuce wraps instead of tortillas and ensure that the marinade is free from added sugars."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I properly peel and devein shrimp?","answer":"To peel shrimp, hold the shrimp in one hand and remove the shell by starting at the head and pulling it down to the tail. To devein, make a shallow cut along the back of the shrimp and remove the dark vein with the tip of your knife or a toothpick."},{"question":"What can I substitute for honey if I want a different flavor?","answer":"You can substitute honey with maple syrup or agave syrup. Both will add sweetness, but each has a unique flavor profile that can slightly change the taste of your dish."},{"question":"How can I tell when shrimp are cooked?","answer":"Shrimp are cooked when they turn pink and opaque. They should also form a 'C' shape. Avoid overcooking as they can become tough and rubbery."},{"question":"What is the best way to warm tortillas?","answer":"For soft and warm tortillas, heat them in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 30 seconds on each side, or you can wrap them in a damp paper towel and microwave them for about 30 seconds."},{"question":"How do I store leftover shrimp tacos?","answer":"Store leftover shrimp in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Keep the tortillas and toppings separate to maintain freshness. Reheat shrimp in a skillet over low heat."},{"question":"Can I use frozen shrimp for this recipe?","answer":"Yes, you can use frozen shrimp! Just make sure to thaw them completely before marinating. You can do this by placing them in the refrigerator overnight or running them under cold water."},{"question":"How do I chop cilantro without it sticking to my knife?","answer":"To prevent cilantro from sticking to your knife, make sure it's dry after washing. Use a sharp knife and chop in a quick, smooth motion. You can also sprinkle a little salt on the cilantro while chopping to help absorb moisture."},{"question":"What is the purpose of marinating the shrimp?","answer":"Marinating the shrimp helps to infuse them with flavor and makes them more tender. Even a short marination time of 10 minutes can enhance the taste significantly!"},{"question":"Is it safe to eat shrimp that has a slight fishy smell?","answer":"Fresh shrimp should have a mild ocean scent. If the smell is strong or overly fishy, it could indicate spoilage. When in doubt, it's better to err on the side of caution."},{"question":"What can I add to my tacos for extra flavor?","answer":"You can add toppings such as diced tomatoes, pickled onions, or a drizzle of sour cream or hot sauce for an extra kick. Experiment with different ingredients to find your favorite combination!"}],"ingredients":[{"name":"shrimp, peeled and deveined","advice":"Choose fresh or frozen shrimp that are large (16-20 count per pound) for a satisfying bite. If using frozen shrimp, thaw them in the refrigerator overnight or under cold running water for quicker thawing. If shrimp are not available, you can substitute with other seafood like scallops or fish, but adjust cooking times accordingly."},{"name":"honey","advice":"Opt for raw honey for a more robust flavor and potential health benefits. If you need a substitute, agave nectar or maple syrup can work, but they will alter the flavor slightly. To enhance the honey's flavor, consider warming it slightly to help it blend better with the other ingredients."},{"name":"soy sauce","advice":"Use low-sodium soy sauce if you want to control the saltiness of the dish. For a gluten-free option, substitute with tamari. Alternatively, liquid aminos can work as a soy sauce substitute while adding a unique flavor."},{"name":"garlic, minced","advice":"Fresh garlic is best for this recipe, but pre-minced garlic can be used in a pinch. For a milder flavor, roast the garlic before adding it to the marinade. If you don’t have garlic, you can use garlic powder at a ratio of 1/8 teaspoon per clove."},{"name":"red pepper flakes","advice":"Adjust the amount of red pepper flakes based on your spice tolerance. For a different heat profile, consider using fresh chopped chili peppers or a dash of hot sauce. If you prefer milder tacos, you can omit them altogether."},{"name":"lime, juiced","advice":"Freshly squeezed lime juice offers the best flavor. If you don’t have limes, you can use lemon juice as a substitute. To enhance the lime flavor, consider adding lime zest to the marinade."},{"name":"tortillas","advice":"Corn tortillas provide a traditional flavor, while flour tortillas give a softer texture. Warm them in a dry skillet for a few seconds on each side to enhance their flavor and flexibility. If you're gluten-free, use corn tortillas or lettuce wraps."},{"name":"cabbage, shredded","advice":"Use green or purple cabbage for added color and nutrients. If you want a crunchier texture, consider adding a mix of shredded carrots. For a different flavor, try using slaw mix or napa cabbage."},{"name":"avocado, sliced","advice":"Choose ripe, but not overly soft avocados for slicing. If avocados are not available, you can substitute with guacamole or a dollop of sour cream. To prevent browning, sprinkle the slices with lime juice."},{"name":"cilantro, chopped","advice":"Fresh cilantro adds brightness; if you're not a fan, try substituting with parsley for a milder flavor. Alternatively, mint can add an interesting twist. Be sure to chop it finely for even distribution."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Adjust salt according to taste, especially if using soy sauce, which is already salty. For a flavor boost, consider using sea salt or kosher salt to enhance the overall taste."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673c0f98e306fadf2e5bec99","name":"Spicy Honey Garlic Shrimp Tacos","ingredients":[{"name":"shrimp, peeled and deveined","quantity":"1 pound","_id":"673c0f9be306fadf2e5becab"},{"name":"honey","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"673c0f9be306fadf2e5becac"},{"name":"soy sauce","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"673c0f9be306fadf2e5becad"},{"name":"garlic, minced","quantity":"3 cloves","_id":"673c0f9be306fadf2e5becae"},{"name":"red pepper flakes","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"673c0f9be306fadf2e5becaf"},{"name":"lime, juiced","quantity":"1","_id":"673c0f9be306fadf2e5becb0"},{"name":"tortillas","quantity":"8 small","_id":"673c0f9be306fadf2e5becb1"},{"name":"cabbage, shredded","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673c0f9be306fadf2e5becb2"},{"name":"avocado, sliced","quantity":"1","_id":"673c0f9be306fadf2e5becb3"},{"name":"cilantro, chopped","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"673c0f9be306fadf2e5becb4"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673c0f9be306fadf2e5becb5"}],"calories":350,"allergens":["Shellfish"],"dietaryTags":["Gluten-Free","Dairy-Free"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":15,"preparationTime":15,"cookingTime":10,"tags":["Quick","Tacos","Seafood","Spicy"],"quickTastyDescription":"Deliciously spicy shrimp with a sweet honey garlic glaze, served in soft tortillas for a perfect taco night!","detailedCookingInstructions":["In a bowl, mix honey, soy sauce, minced garlic, lime juice, and red pepper flakes.","Add the shrimp to the bowl and toss to coat well.
