For celery, wash the stalks, trim the ends, and chop them into small pieces. Practice makes perfect!"},{"question":"What kind of bread should I use for stuffing?","answer":"You can use any bread you like, but a sturdy bread like sourdough, ciabatta, or French bread is ideal. Just make sure it's slightly stale or toasted to help it hold up during cooking."},{"question":"How do I know when my stuffing is done baking?","answer":"Your stuffing is done when the top is golden brown and crispy.

If you don't have cubed bread, you can cut any bread into cubes and let it dry out overnight. Alternatively, use cornbread for a different flavor."},{"name":"chicken or vegetable broth","advice":"Homemade broth will enhance the flavor significantly, but store-bought works well too. For a lower sodium option, use low-sodium broth. If you need a substitute, water mixed with a bit of soy sauce or nutritional yeast can provide a similar umami flavor."},{"name":"dried cranberries","advice":"For extra flavor, consider soaking the cranberries in warm water or orange juice for about 10 minutes before adding them to the mixture. If you're out of cranberries, raisins or chopped dried apricots can serve as good substitutes."},{"name":"chopped pecans","advice":"Toast the pecans in a dry skillet for a few minutes to enhance their flavor before adding.

If you're looking for a dairy-free option, olive oil or vegan butter can be used instead."},{"name":"sage","advice":"Fresh sage will give a more vibrant flavor than dried. If you use dried, reduce the amount by half.

Taste as you go to avoid over-salting."},{"name":"pepper","advice":"Freshly cracked black pepper provides the best flavor.
