For medium-rare, aim for an internal temperature of 130°F (54°C).

You can also serve it with horseradish sauce or a rich gravy."},{"question":"Can I use dried herbs instead of fresh?","answer":"Yes, you can use dried herbs if fresh aren't available.

The seasoning rub will enhance its taste without the need for marinating."},{"question":"How do I ensure the seasoning sticks to the meat?","answer":"Rubbing the roast with olive oil before applying the seasoning helps it stick better. The oil creates a nice surface for the spices to adhere to."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"prime rib roast","advice":"Look for a well-marbled roast, as the fat will enhance flavor and juiciness.
