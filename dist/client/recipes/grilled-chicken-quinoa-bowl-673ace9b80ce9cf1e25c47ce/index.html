You can also substitute chicken thighs for a more flavorful option. If you&#x27;re looking for a vegetarian alternative, grilled tofu works well.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">quinoa</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Rinse quinoa under cold water before cooking to remove its bitter saponin coating. For added flavor, cook quinoa in vegetable or chicken broth instead of water. If you need a gluten-free substitute, use millet or rice.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">bell pepper</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Choose a vibrant, firm bell pepper for the best flavor and texture. You can substitute with other colors for a more colorful dish, or try roasted red peppers for a smokier taste.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">cucumber</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Use a seedless cucumber for a crisper texture. For extra flavor, you can marinate the cucumber in a bit of vinegar and salt before adding it to the bowl. If you want a different crunch, consider using radishes instead.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">cherry tomatoes</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Look for firm, bright cherry tomatoes for the best taste. To enhance their sweetness, you can roast them in the oven for 10-15 minutes before adding them to the bowl. If unavailable, grape tomatoes are a good substitute.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">olive oil</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Use extra virgin olive oil for the best flavor. You can substitute with avocado oil for a higher smoke point or flavored oils like garlic-infused olive oil to add extra depth.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">lemon juice</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Freshly squeezed lemon juice is always preferable for flavor. If you don’t have fresh lemons, bottled lemon juice can be used, but it may not have the same brightness. Lime juice can also serve as a substitute for a different tang.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">salt</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Use kosher salt for seasoning as it dissolves easily and provides a cleaner taste. Try adding flavored salts, like garlic salt or herb salt, for additional flavor.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">pepper</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Freshly cracked black pepper provides the best flavor. If you want to spice things up, consider adding red pepper flakes or a dash of cayenne pepper.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">fresh parsley</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Chop the parsley just before adding to maintain its freshness and color.
