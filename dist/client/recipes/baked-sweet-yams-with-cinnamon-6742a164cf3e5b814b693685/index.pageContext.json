A side of sautéed green beans or a fresh kale salad can add a nice crunch and balance to the meal. For beverages, consider a lightly chilled Riesling or a fruity red wine like Pinot Noir, which will enhance the flavors of the yams. For a non-alcoholic option, a spiced apple cider would be lovely.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the baked sweet yams warm, directly from the oven, and garnish with a sprinkle of extra cinnamon or a drizzle of maple syrup for added sweetness.

Pair with a dollop of Greek yogurt or whipped cream for a creamy contrast that enhances the dish's overall richness.","dietary_considerations":"This recipe is naturally gluten-free and can be made vegan by substituting the butter with olive oil or coconut oil.

If you're new to peeling, watch a quick video tutorial to see how it's done!"},{"question":"What is the best way to cut sweet yams?","answer":"After peeling, place the yams on a cutting board.

They can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving."},{"question":"Is it safe to use a sharp knife in the kitchen?","answer":"Yes, using a sharp knife is actually safer than a dull one.
