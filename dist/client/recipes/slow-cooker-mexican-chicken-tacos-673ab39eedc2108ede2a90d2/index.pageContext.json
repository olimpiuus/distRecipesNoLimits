A side of Mexican street corn (elote) brings in a sweet and creamy flavor that complements the spiciness of the tacos. For beverages, consider a chilled Mexican lager such as Corona or Modelo, or a refreshing margarita to enhance the fiesta vibe. If you prefer non-alcoholic options, a lime-infused sparkling water or a fruity agua fresca (like agua de jamaica) would be refreshing choices.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the tacos on a vibrant platter garnished with fresh cilantro and lime wedges to add a burst of color and freshness. Provide a taco bar setup where guests can customize their tacos with various toppings such as jalapeños, avocado slices, or hot sauce. For added flavor, consider a sprinkle of crumbled queso fresco on top of the assembled tacos. If hosting a gathering, set up a taco-making station with all ingredients laid out, allowing guests to create their own personalized tacos.","dietary_considerations":"This recipe is quite versatile! For a gluten-free option, use corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas. To make it dairy-free, simply skip the cheese and sour cream or substitute with dairy-free alternatives like cashew cheese or coconut yogurt.
