Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this can compact the flour and result in using too much."},{"question":"What is the purpose of baking powder in a cake?","answer":"Baking powder is a leavening agent that helps the cake rise. It produces carbon dioxide gas when mixed with wet ingredients, creating air pockets that make your cake light and fluffy."},{"question":"How can I tell when my cake is done baking?","answer":"To check if your cake is done, insert a toothpick into the center.

If it comes out wet, give it a few more minutes."},{"question":"Can I substitute whole wheat flour with all-purpose flour?","answer":"Yes, you can substitute all-purpose flour for whole wheat flour.
