Cut the bread into cubes and let them sit out for a few hours to dry, or toast them in the oven at a low temperature until they're firm but not browned."},{"question":"How important is it to chop the vegetables evenly?","answer":"Chopping vegetables evenly ensures they cook at the same rate, which helps avoid mushy or crunchy bits.

You can also use water, but it will be less flavorful."},{"question":"How do I know when the dressing is done baking?","answer":"Look for a golden brown top and a crispy texture.

This helps them absorb the broth without becoming mushy. You can substitute with cornbread or gluten-free bread for different flavors or dietary needs."},{"name":"onion, diced","advice":"Use yellow or sweet onions for a milder flavor. If you prefer a stronger taste, red onions can be used. For a milder option, you can substitute with shallots or leeks. Sautéing the onion until translucent enhances its sweetness."},{"name":"celery, diced","advice":"Celery adds crunch and a fresh flavor. If you don't have celery, you can use diced carrots or bell peppers for a different texture and taste. Make sure to chop it finely to ensure it cooks quickly and blends well with the bread."},{"name":"butter","advice":"Butter adds richness; however, you can substitute with olive oil or margarine for a healthier option. If you want a deeper flavor, consider using browned butter. Make sure to melt it gently to prevent burning."},{"name":"chicken broth","advice":"Homemade broth is best for flavor, but store-bought is convenient. Use low-sodium broth to control the saltiness. For a vegetarian option, substitute with vegetable broth. You can also add a splash of white wine for extra depth."},{"name":"sage","advice":"Fresh sage has a more vibrant flavor than dried; if using fresh, use about 1 tablespoon instead of 1 teaspoon. If you don't have sage, try using poultry seasoning or thyme as a substitute for a more complex flavor."},{"name":"thyme","advice":"Fresh thyme can be used in place of dried; use about 1 tablespoon fresh for every teaspoon dried. Thyme can be substituted with rosemary for a different aromatic profile, or oregano for an Italian twist."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Adjust the salt based on the saltiness of your broth. You can also use sea salt or kosher salt for a different texture. If you're watching sodium intake, consider using salt-free seasoning blends."},{"name":"pepper","advice":"Freshly ground black pepper provides the best flavor.
