Perfect for holiday gatherings!","cookingSteps":[{"name":"Combine the Ingredients","description":"In a mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of eggnog, 1 cup of heavy cream, 3/4 cup of sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1/2 teaspoon of ground nutmeg. Make sure to use fresh eggnog for the best flavor."},{"name":"Whisk Until Smooth","description":"Whisk the mixture thoroughly until the sugar is fully dissolved and the ingredients are well combined. This may take about 2-3 minutes of vigorous whisking. Ensure there are no lumps of sugar remaining."},{"name":"Churn the Mixture","description":"Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker. Churn according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually for about 20-25 minutes. The mixture should become thick and creamy. If you don’t have an ice cream maker, pour the mixture into a shallow dish and freeze it, stirring every 30 minutes until it reaches the desired consistency."},{"name":"Freeze the Ice Cream","description":"Once churned, transfer the ice cream to an airtight container. Freeze for at least 4 hours until firm. This step is crucial for achieving the right texture."},{"name":"Serve and Garnish","description":"Scoop the ice cream into bowls or cones and serve immediately. Optionally, garnish with extra nutmeg or a dollop of whipped cream for added flavor and presentation."}],"pairings":{"pairings":"Eggnog Ice Cream pairs wonderfully with spiced cookies, gingerbread, or rich chocolate desserts. For beverages, consider pairing it with a warm spiced cider, a glass of bourbon or rum, or a classic coffee for a delightful contrast in temperatures and flavors.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the Eggnog Ice Cream in chilled bowls or glasses for an elegant touch. For a festive presentation, scoop the ice cream into a Christmas-themed sundae dish and top with a sprinkle of ground nutmeg and a dollop of freshly whipped cream. You can also serve it alongside a slice of pie, such as pumpkin or pecan, to enhance the seasonal flavors.","dietary_considerations":"For dairy-free or vegan options, substitute the heavy cream with coconut cream and use a plant-based eggnog. If you want to reduce the sugar content, consider using a sugar substitute that measures like sugar or opt for a lower-sugar eggnog variant."},"faqs":[{"question":"What is the best way to whisk ingredients together?","answer":"Use a balloon whisk or electric mixer to combine ingredients thoroughly. Start slowly to avoid splattering, and increase speed as needed. Make sure the sugar is fully dissolved for a smooth texture."},{"question":"How do I know when my ice cream is finished churning?","answer":"The ice cream is ready when it has doubled in volume and has a soft-serve consistency. It typically takes about 20-25 minutes, but check your ice cream maker's instructions for specific timing."},{"question":"What if I don't have an ice cream maker?","answer":"You can still make ice cream by pouring the mixture into a shallow dish and placing it in the freezer. Stir every 30 minutes for the first 2-3 hours to break up ice crystals until it reaches your desired consistency."},{"question":"How can I ensure my ice cream is creamy and not icy?","answer":"Using heavy cream and churning the mixture properly will help create a creamy texture. Avoid over-freezing and ensure the mixture is well combined before churning."},{"question":"What should I do if my sugar isn't dissolving?","answer":"Make sure to whisk your mixture thoroughly. If it still doesn’t dissolve, you can gently heat the mixture on the stove until just warm, then whisk until the sugar is fully dissolved, and cool before pouring into the ice cream maker."},{"question":"Can I adjust the flavor of my eggnog ice cream?","answer":"Absolutely! You can add spices like cinnamon or ginger for extra warmth, or even a splash of bourbon or rum for a more traditional eggnog flavor, but adjust to taste."},{"question":"How do I store leftover ice cream?","answer":"Store your ice cream in an airtight container to prevent freezer burn. It can last for up to 2 weeks in the freezer, but for the best quality, consume within a week."},{"question":"Is it safe to eat homemade ice cream with eggnog?","answer":"Yes, as long as you use pasteurized eggnog. If you're concerned about raw eggs, look for eggnog made with pasteurized eggs or consider using a custard base instead."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"eggnog","advice":"Use store-bought eggnog for convenience, or make your own by mixing milk, cream, eggs, sugar, and nutmeg. If you want a non-alcoholic version, ensure to choose an eggnog that explicitly states it is alcohol-free. For a vegan option, look for plant-based eggnog made from almond milk, soy milk, or coconut milk."},{"name":"heavy cream","advice":"Heavy cream contributes to the creaminess of the ice cream. If you're looking for a lighter alternative, you can substitute half-and-half, but this will result in a less rich texture. For a dairy-free option, use coconut cream or a cashew cream."},{"name":"sugar","advice":"Granulated sugar is standard, but you can experiment with brown sugar for a deeper flavor. You can also use alternatives like honey, maple syrup, or granulated stevia, but note that these may alter the texture and sweetness level."},{"name":"vanilla extract","advice":"Use pure vanilla extract for the best flavor. If you don’t have it, you can substitute with vanilla bean paste or scrape the seeds from a vanilla pod. For a different flavor profile, consider using almond extract, but reduce the quantity as it is stronger."},{"name":"ground nutmeg","advice":"Freshly grated nutmeg will provide a more intense flavor compared to pre-ground nutmeg. If you don’t have nutmeg, you can substitute with ground cinnamon or allspice, but keep the amount small to avoid overpowering the eggnog flavor."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"67401f8c6da16aa2e977423a","name":"Eggnog Ice Cream","ingredients":[{"name":"eggnog","quantity":"2 cups","_id":"67401f8e6da16aa2e9774248"},{"name":"heavy cream","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"67401f8e6da16aa2e9774249"},{"name":"sugar","quantity":"3/4 cup","_id":"67401f8e6da16aa2e977424a"},{"name":"vanilla extract","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"67401f8e6da16aa2e977424b"},{"name":"ground nutmeg","quantity":"1/2 teaspoon","_id":"67401f8e6da16aa2e977424c"}],"calories":250,"allergens":["Dairy","Eggs"],"dietaryTags":["Vegetarian"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":6.5,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":0,"tags":["Dessert","Frozen Treats","Holiday"],"quickTastyDescription":"Creamy, festive eggnog ice cream that captures the flavors of the holiday season in every scoop.","detailedCookingInstructions":["In a mixing bowl, combine the eggnog, heavy cream, sugar, vanilla extract, and ground nutmeg.","Whisk the mixture until the sugar is fully dissolved and everything is well combined.","Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions (usually about 20-25 minutes).","Once churned, transfer the ice cream to an airtight container and freeze for at least 4 hours until firm.","Scoop and serve, optionally garnished with extra nutmeg or whipped cream."],"createdByModel":"4o","detailedName":"Creamy Eggnog Ice Cream","baseMeal":"Ice Cream","modifiersForBase":"Flavored with eggnog and spices","imageUrl":"/images/eggnog-ice-cream-67401f8c6da16aa2e9774240.webp","image":"67401f8c6da16aa2e9774240","servings":6,"cuisine":["American"],"course":["Dessert"],"dateCreated":"2024-11-22T06:07:10.691Z","createdAt":"2024-11-22T06:07:10.694Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-23T06:06:14.580Z","__v":0,"mealUrl":"eggnog-ice-cream-67401f8c6da16aa2e977423a"},"__v":0}}
