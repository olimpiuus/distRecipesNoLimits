Avoid any that are soft or have blemishes. If fresh cranberries are not available, you can substitute with frozen cranberries, but do not thaw them before cooking, as they will release more juice during the cooking process.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">granulated sugar</h3><p class="text-gray-700">You can adjust the sweetness to your taste by reducing the sugar slightly or using alternatives like honey or maple syrup. If using a sugar substitute, ensure it&#x27;s suitable for cooking and adjust quantities according to the product&#x27;s instructions.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">water</h3><p class="text-gray-700">For added flavor, consider substituting part of the water with orange juice or apple juice.

You can also experiment by adding a pinch of nutmeg or allspice for additional warmth.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">vanilla extract</h3><p class="text-gray-700">For a more robust vanilla flavor, consider using pure vanilla extract instead of imitation. If you want to experiment, you can infuse the sauce with a vanilla bean by splitting it and adding it during the cooking process, then removing it before serving.</p></div></div></section><section class="mb-12 text-justify"><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8 text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500 to-orange-600">Cooking Steps</h2><ul class="space-y-6"><li id="coocking-step-rinse-the-cranberries" class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-orange-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-800">Step <!-- -->1<!-- -->: <span class="text-orange-600">Rinse the Cranberries</span></h3><div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span>Start by rinsing 12 oz of fresh cranberries under cold running water.
