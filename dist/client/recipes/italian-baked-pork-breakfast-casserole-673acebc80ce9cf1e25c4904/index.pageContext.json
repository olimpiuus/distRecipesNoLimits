You can also use a toothpick inserted in the center; it should come out clean."},{"question":"Can I substitute ingredients in the recipe?","answer":"Absolutely! You can substitute ground pork with ground turkey or beef. For the cheeses, feel free to use a cheese you prefer, like cheddar.

If you prefer a richer flavor, try using ground beef or sausage. Make sure to cook the pork thoroughly to avoid any health risks."},{"name":"eggs","advice":"Fresh eggs will yield the best flavor and texture. For a fluffier casserole, beat the eggs well before mixing with other ingredients. If you're looking for a dairy-free option, you can substitute eggs with a mixture of silken tofu or a commercial egg replacer."},{"name":"milk","advice":"Use whole milk for creaminess, or substitute with almond milk or oat milk for a dairy-free version.

For a spicier kick, consider adding cayenne pepper or using white pepper for a milder taste."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Extra virgin olive oil offers the best flavor.
