If you prefer a richer flavor, try using ground beef or sausage. Make sure to cook the pork thoroughly to avoid any health risks.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">eggs</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Fresh eggs will yield the best flavor and texture. For a fluffier casserole, beat the eggs well before mixing with other ingredients. If you&#x27;re looking for a dairy-free option, you can substitute eggs with a mixture of silken tofu or a commercial egg replacer.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">milk</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Use whole milk for creaminess, or substitute with almond milk or oat milk for a dairy-free version. You can also use half-and-half for a richer flavor. If you&#x27;re watching your calories, consider using skim milk.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">italian seasoning</h3><p class="text-gray-700">You can easily make your own Italian seasoning using equal parts of dried basil, oregano, thyme, and rosemary. If you like a bit of heat, add a pinch of red pepper flakes. Fresh herbs can also be used if you have them on hand, but use them in larger quantities.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">bell peppers (diced)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Any color of bell pepper works well, but red or yellow will add a sweeter flavor. If you don’t have bell peppers, zucchini or mushrooms can be good substitutes. For added flavor, roast the bell peppers before adding them to the mixture.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">onion (diced)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Yellow onions are the most versatile for this recipe, but you can also use red onions for a slightly sweeter taste. To enhance the flavor, caramelize the onions before adding them to the skillet.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">mozzarella cheese (shredded)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Fresh mozzarella will melt beautifully, but you can also use low-moisture mozzarella for a firmer texture. For a twist, try using provolone or fontina cheese. If you want a dairy-free option, use a plant-based cheese substitute.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">parmesan cheese (grated)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Freshly grated Parmesan offers more flavor than pre-grated. If you need a substitute, Pecorino Romano can give a sharper taste. Nutritional yeast can be used for a dairy-free, cheesy flavor.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">salt</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Adjust the amount of salt based on your dietary needs or preferences. If using cheese in the recipe, you may want to reduce the salt since cheese can be quite salty.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">black pepper</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Freshly cracked black pepper will add more flavor than pre-ground. For a spicier kick, consider adding cayenne pepper or using white pepper for a milder taste.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">olive oil</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Extra virgin olive oil offers the best flavor. If you&#x27;re looking for a lighter option, you can substitute with a vegetable oil or avocado oil.
