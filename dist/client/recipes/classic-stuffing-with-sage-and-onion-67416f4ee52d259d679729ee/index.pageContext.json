Just make sure it's stale or dried out so it absorbs the broth without getting soggy."},{"question":"How do I chop an onion without crying?","answer":"To minimize tears, try chilling the onion in the fridge for 30 minutes before cutting it.

You can use any type of bread, such as white, whole wheat, sourdough, or even cornbread. If you're gluten-free, consider using gluten-free bread or a bread alternative."},{"name":"butter","advice":"Butter adds rich flavor to the stuffing. If you're looking for a lighter option, you can substitute half of the butter with olive oil or a plant-based butter. For a different flavor profile, try using herb-infused butter."},{"name":"onion, chopped","advice":"Onions add sweetness and depth to the stuffing. You can substitute with shallots for a milder taste or even leeks for a more subtle flavor. For a sweeter note, caramelize the onions before adding them to the mixture."},{"name":"celery, chopped","advice":"Celery provides crunch and a fresh flavor. If you don't have celery, you can replace it with diced bell peppers or carrots for a different texture and taste. Fresh herbs like parsley can also add a similar freshness."},{"name":"sage, dried","advice":"Dried sage is potent; if you prefer fresh, use about three times the amount of fresh sage as it has a milder flavor.
