Make sure to pick out any that are soft, shriveled, or damaged—these can affect the texture of your sauce."},{"name":"Combine Water and Sugar","description":"In a medium saucepan, combine 1 cup of water and 1 cup of sugar over medium heat. Stir the mixture gently until the sugar completely dissolves. This step is crucial because it forms the base of your sauce."},{"name":"Add Cranberries","description":"Once the sugar is dissolved, add the rinsed cranberries to the saucepan.

This will activate the natural pectin in the cranberries, which helps thicken the sauce."},{"name":"Simmer the Sauce","description":"When the mixture reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 10-12 minutes. During this time, stir occasionally. You'll notice the cranberries will start to burst, releasing their juices, which creates a beautiful sauce."},{"name":"Incorporate Orange Zest and Juice","description":"After the cranberries have burst and the sauce has thickened, stir in 1 tablespoon of orange zest and 1/2 cup of orange juice.

For a vegetarian option, serve it alongside a nut and cheese platter or as a condiment for a savory tart.

For a more casual setting, drizzle it over crostini topped with cream cheese or goat cheese for an appealing appetizer.","dietary_considerations":"This cranberry sauce is naturally vegetarian and gluten-free. For a lower sugar version, you can substitute half of the sugar with a sugar alternative like agave syrup or maple syrup. Additionally, for those watching their sugar intake, consider using unsweetened cranberry juice in place of the water and sugar, though this may alter the texture slightly."},"faqs":[{"question":"What should I do if I can't find fresh cranberries?","answer":"You can use frozen cranberries instead. Just rinse them under cold water before using them, and you can cook them without thawing."},{"question":"How do I properly zest an orange?","answer":"Use a microplane or a zester to lightly scrape the outer peel of the orange, avoiding the white pith underneath, which can be bitter."},{"question":"What does it mean to simmer, and how do I do it?","answer":"Simmering means cooking at a low heat where small bubbles occasionally rise to the surface. After bringing your mixture to a boil, lower the heat and adjust it so that it bubbles gently."},{"question":"How can I tell when the cranberries are done cooking?","answer":"The cranberries will burst open and the mixture will thicken.
