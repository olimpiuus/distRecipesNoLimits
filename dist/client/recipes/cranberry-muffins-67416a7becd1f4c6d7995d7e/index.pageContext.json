Spoon the flour into your measuring cup, then use a straight edge, like a knife, to level it off. Avoid scooping directly with the cup as this can pack the flour and result in using too much."},{"question":"How do I properly prepare fresh cranberries for baking?","answer":"Fresh cranberries should be rinsed under cold water and any stems or bad berries removed.
