This guilt-free dessert is perfect for any occasion, using simple ingredients and no added sugar!","cookingSteps":[{"name":"Preheat the Oven","description":"Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This step is crucial as it ensures that your cake bakes evenly. While the oven is heating, you can prepare the cake batter."},{"name":"Prepare the Cake Pan","description":"Grease an 8-inch round cake pan with butter or cooking spray to prevent sticking. You can also line the bottom with parchment paper for easier removal."},{"name":"Mix Dry Ingredients","description":"In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup of granulated stevia, 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Mix these dry ingredients thoroughly to ensure even distribution."},{"name":"Beat the Eggs and Add Wet Ingredients","description":"In another bowl, crack 3 eggs and beat them until they are frothy. Then, add 1/2 cup of milk, 1/4 cup of melted unsalted butter, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Mix until all the wet ingredients are well combined."},{"name":"Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients","description":"Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to over-mix; a few lumps are okay. This will help keep your sponge cake light and fluffy."},{"name":"Pour Batter into the Cake Pan","description":"Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and spread it evenly using a spatula. This will ensure that the cake bakes uniformly."},{"name":"Bake the Cake","description":"Place the cake pan in the preheated oven and bake for about 25-30 minutes. To check if the cake is done, insert a toothpick into the center; it should come out clean or with a few crumbs attached."},{"name":"Cool the Cake","description":"Once baked, let the cake cool in the pan for about 5-10 minutes. Then, carefully transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Cooling on a wire rack allows air to circulate around the cake, preventing it from becoming soggy."}],"pairings":{"pairings":"This Vanilla Sponge Cake pairs beautifully with fresh berries such as strawberries, blueberries, or raspberries, which add a burst of tangy flavor to complement the sweetness of the cake. A light whipped cream or a dollop of Greek yogurt can enhance the richness without overpowering the cake. For beverages, consider serving it with a cup of Earl Grey tea, a glass of sparkling prosecco, or a refreshing iced herbal tea, which will bring out the vanilla notes in the cake.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the Vanilla Sponge Cake at room temperature for the best flavor and texture. For an elegant presentation, dust the top lightly with powdered stevia or cocoa powder and garnish with fresh mint leaves or edible flowers. You could also layer the cake with a light frosting made from whipped cream and vanilla extract or create a layered dessert by slicing the cake into layers and filling it with fruit compote or yogurt in between. This makes it perfect for afternoon tea, birthday parties, or any celebratory occasion.","dietary_considerations":"This cake is suitable for those looking to reduce sugar intake, thanks to the use of stevia as a sugar substitute. For gluten-free guests, you can substitute the all-purpose flour with a gluten-free flour blend. Additionally, for a dairy-free version, you can replace the milk with almond milk or coconut milk and use a plant-based butter alternative. Always check the stevia product for any additional ingredients that may not align with specific dietary needs."},"faqs":[{"question":"What is the best way to measure flour accurately?","answer":"To measure flour accurately, use the spoon-and-level method: spoon the flour into your measuring cup without packing it down, then level it off with a straight edge, like a knife. This ensures you have the right amount without adding too much."},{"question":"How do I know when my cake is done baking?","answer":"A simple way to test if your cake is done is to insert a toothpick into the center. If it comes out clean or with a few crumbs (not wet batter), your cake is ready. Keep an eye on it towards the end of the baking time."},{"question":"Can I substitute stevia with regular sugar?","answer":"Yes, you can substitute stevia with regular sugar. However, since stevia is much sweeter than sugar, you would need to adjust the quantity. Generally, 1 cup of sugar is equivalent to about 1/2 cup of stevia, but check the specific product instructions for the best ratio."},{"question":"What should I do if my cake is too dry?","answer":"If your cake turns out dry, it may have been overbaked or had too much flour. To prevent this, ensure you check for doneness early and use the correct measuring methods. If it happens, you can also serve it with a simple syrup or fresh fruit to add moisture."},{"question":"Is it important to let the cake cool before removing it from the pan?","answer":"Yes, letting the cake cool for a few minutes in the pan allows it to firm up and makes it easier to remove without breaking. After a few minutes, gently run a knife around the edges before inverting it onto a wire rack."},{"question":"How can I safely melt butter without burning it?","answer":"To melt butter without burning, cut it into small pieces and place it in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave it in short bursts of 10-15 seconds, stirring in between, until fully melted. Alternatively, you can melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat on the stove."},{"question":"What’s the best way to grease a cake pan?","answer":"To grease a cake pan, use a paper towel or pastry brush to apply a thin layer of unsalted butter or cooking spray. For added protection against sticking, you can also dust the greased pan with a little flour after greasing, tapping out the excess."},{"question":"How do I store leftover cake?","answer":"Store leftover cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. If you want to keep it longer, you can refrigerate it, but be aware that it may dry out. For longer storage, wrap the cake in plastic wrap and freeze it."},{"question":"Can I use other types of milk instead of regular milk?","answer":"Yes, you can use other types of milk such as almond, soy, or oat milk. The flavor and texture may vary slightly, but they can work well as substitutes in baking."},{"question":"What is the purpose of baking powder in the recipe?","answer":"Baking powder is a leavening agent. It creates carbon dioxide gas when mixed with wet ingredients, causing the batter to rise and giving the cake a light and fluffy texture."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"all-purpose flour","advice":"Make sure to spoon and level the flour when measuring to avoid packing it down, which can result in a denser cake. If you want a gluten-free option, substitute with a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend, adjusting the amount of liquid slightly as needed."},{"name":"stevia (granulated)","advice":"Stevia is much sweeter than sugar, so adjust the quantity according to your taste preference and the specific brand you're using, as some can be more potent. If you're looking for a different sweetener, erythritol or monk fruit sweetener can be good substitutes."},{"name":"baking powder","advice":"Ensure your baking powder is fresh for the best rise. If you don't have any, you can make a substitute using 1/4 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp vinegar or lemon juice per teaspoon of baking powder needed."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Salt enhances the flavor of the cake, so don’t omit it. You can use kosher salt or sea salt in place of table salt, but remember that the measurement may differ slightly due to grain size."},{"name":"eggs","advice":"Use room temperature eggs for better incorporation into the batter, which can lead to a fluffier cake. If you need an egg substitute, consider using 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce or 1/4 cup yogurt for each egg."},{"name":"milk","advice":"You can use any milk variety, including almond, soy, or oat milk for a dairy-free version. For a richer flavor, consider using whole milk or buttermilk."},{"name":"vanilla extract","advice":"For a more intense vanilla flavor, consider using pure vanilla extract instead of imitation. You can also enhance the flavor by adding a splash of almond extract or using vanilla bean paste."},{"name":"unsalted butter (melted)","advice":"Melt the butter gently and let it cool slightly before adding it to your mix to avoid cooking the eggs. If you want a dairy-free option, you can substitute with coconut oil or a plant-based butter."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673987e21bf69c8500305f21","name":"Vanilla Sponge Cake with Stevia","ingredients":[{"name":"all-purpose flour","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673987e51bf69c8500305f2c"},{"name":"stevia (granulated)","quantity":"1/2 cup","_id":"673987e51bf69c8500305f2d"},{"name":"baking powder","quantity":"1 1/2 tsp","_id":"673987e51bf69c8500305f2e"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"1/4 tsp","_id":"673987e51bf69c8500305f2f"},{"name":"eggs","quantity":"3","_id":"673987e51bf69c8500305f30"},{"name":"milk","quantity":"1/2 cup","_id":"673987e51bf69c8500305f31"},{"name":"vanilla extract","quantity":"1 tsp","_id":"673987e51bf69c8500305f32"},{"name":"unsalted butter (melted)","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"673987e51bf69c8500305f33"}],"calories":150,"allergens":["Gluten","Eggs","Dairy"],"dietaryTags":["Low Sugar","Vegetarian"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":5,"preparationTime":15,"cookingTime":30,"tags":["Dessert","Baking","Healthy"],"quickTastyDescription":"A light and fluffy vanilla sponge cake sweetened with stevia for a healthier twist!","detailedCookingInstructions":["Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease an 8-inch round cake pan.","In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, stevia, baking powder, and salt.
