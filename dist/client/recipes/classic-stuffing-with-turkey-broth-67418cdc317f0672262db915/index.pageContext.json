You can use any type of bread, such as white, whole wheat, or even cornbread. If you only have fresh bread, toast it lightly before using."},{"question":"How do I chop an onion without crying?","answer":"To minimize tears, try chilling the onion in the fridge for 30 minutes before cutting. You can also cut the root end last, as it contains the highest concentration of sulfur compounds that make you cry."},{"question":"How can I ensure my stuffing is seasoned well?","answer":"Taste as you go! After mixing your ingredients, take a small spoonful and taste it. If it needs more flavor, add more salt, pepper, or herbs as needed."},{"question":"What can I substitute for turkey broth?","answer":"If you don’t have turkey broth, chicken broth or vegetable broth are great substitutes.

For a twist, consider using different types of bread, such as sourdough, whole grain, or cornbread."},{"name":"turkey broth","advice":"If you don't have turkey broth, chicken broth or vegetable broth can be used as substitutes.
