For celery, cut off the ends and slice it into manageable sections. For onion, cut it in half from root to tip, peel off the skin, and make horizontal and vertical cuts before dicing. Always keep your fingers tucked under to avoid cuts!"},{"question":"What can I use instead of chicken broth?","answer":"If you don't have chicken broth, you can use vegetable broth or even water with a bit of added seasoning.
