Adjust the chili powder to suit spice levels according to dietary preferences."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I prepare fresh corn for this salad?","answer":"To prepare fresh corn, you can either grill or boil it. If boiling, cook the corn in salted water for about 5-7 minutes until tender. If grilling, place the corn on a preheated grill for about the same time, turning occasionally until cooked. Once done, let it cool slightly before cutting the kernels off the cob."},{"question":"Can I use canned corn instead of fresh or frozen?","answer":"Yes, you can use canned corn! Just drain and rinse it before adding to the salad. This is a quick and easy alternative."},{"question":"What can I substitute for feta cheese?","answer":"If you want a different flavor or need a dairy-free option, try using crumbled goat cheese, queso fresco, or even a dairy-free cheese alternative."},{"question":"How do I chop red onion finely?","answer":"To chop red onion finely, start by cutting off the ends and peeling the skin. Cut the onion in half from top to bottom, then slice thinly from root to tip on each half. Finally, chop across those slices to create small pieces."},{"question":"Is there a way to make this salad ahead of time?","answer":"Yes! You can prepare the salad up to the point of mixing in the dressing. Store the corn mixture in the fridge and add the dressing just before serving to keep everything fresh."},{"question":"How can I add more flavor to the salad?","answer":"You can add more flavor by incorporating diced jalapeños for heat, adding avocado for creaminess, or including more herbs like parsley or green onions."},{"question":"What if I don't have lime juice?","answer":"If you don’t have lime juice, you can substitute with lemon juice or vinegar (like apple cider or red wine vinegar) for a similar tangy flavor."},{"question":"How do I know when the corn is cooked properly?","answer":"Corn is cooked properly when it's tender and bright yellow. You can test it by piercing a kernel with a fork; it should be firm but easily break apart."},{"question":"Can I serve this salad warm?","answer":"Yes, you can serve it warm, but the flavors are often better when allowed to chill for about 30 minutes in the fridge."},{"question":"What should I do if I accidentally over-salt the salad?","answer":"If you find the salad is too salty, you can add more corn or other ingredients like diced tomatoes or avocado to help balance the flavors."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"sweet corn (fresh or frozen)","advice":"If using fresh corn, opt for sweet, in-season corn for the best flavor. Grill or boil it with the husks on for added moisture and smokiness. If using frozen corn, choose high-quality brands without added sugars or preservatives, and cook until just tender to maintain a sweet flavor."},{"name":"feta cheese, crumbled","advice":"Feta adds a tangy flavor and creamy texture to the salad. If you want a milder taste, try using goat cheese or cotija cheese as a substitute. For a dairy-free option, use a crumbled tofu seasoned with lemon juice and salt."},{"name":"red onion, finely chopped","advice":"To reduce the sharpness of raw red onion, soak the chopped onion in cold water for 10-15 minutes, then drain before adding to the salad. Alternatively, use green onions or shallots for a milder flavor."},{"name":"cilantro, chopped","advice":"For a fresh, vibrant flavor, use fresh cilantro only. If you're not a fan of cilantro, parsley can be a suitable substitute, though it will change the flavor profile. Add the cilantro at the end to maintain its freshness."},{"name":"lime juice","advice":"Freshly squeezed lime juice is much more flavorful than bottled. If lime isn’t available, lemon juice can be used as a substitute, although it will impart a different flavor. To enhance the citrus flavor, consider adding lime zest as well."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Use extra virgin olive oil for the best flavor in your dressing. If you're looking for a lighter option, you could substitute with avocado oil, which has a similar consistency and flavor profile."},{"name":"chili powder","advice":"Chili powder can vary in heat and flavor; taste your chili powder first. For a spicier kick, consider using cayenne pepper or a chipotle chili powder. If you prefer a milder flavor, you can substitute it with smoked paprika."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Always taste before adding salt, as feta cheese is already salty. If you prefer a lower sodium option, consider using a salt substitute or simply reduce the amount used in the dressing."},{"name":"pepper","advice":"Freshly cracked black pepper adds a great depth of flavor. For added complexity, consider using white pepper or even a pinch of red pepper flakes for a slight heat."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673ab3deedc2108ede2a918d","name":"Mexican Street Corn Salad","ingredients":[{"name":"sweet corn (fresh or frozen)","quantity":"4 cups","_id":"673ab3e0edc2108ede2a919b"},{"name":"feta cheese, crumbled","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673ab3e0edc2108ede2a919c"},{"name":"red onion, finely chopped","quantity":"1/2 cup","_id":"673ab3e0edc2108ede2a919d"},{"name":"cilantro, chopped","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"673ab3e0edc2108ede2a919e"},{"name":"lime juice","quantity":"3 tablespoons","_id":"673ab3e0edc2108ede2a919f"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"673ab3e0edc2108ede2a91a0"},{"name":"chili powder","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"673ab3e0edc2108ede2a91a1"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673ab3e0edc2108ede2a91a2"},{"name":"pepper","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673ab3e0edc2108ede2a91a3"}],"calories":200,"allergens":["Dairy"],"dietaryTags":["Vegetarian","Gluten-Free"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":10,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":10,"tags":["Salad","Easy","Mexican","Vegetarian"],"quickTastyDescription":"A fresh, flavorful salad with the essence of street corn, combining sweet corn, tangy lime, creamy feta, and vibrant cilantro!","detailedCookingInstructions":["If using fresh corn, grill or boil the corn until tender, about 5-7 minutes.
