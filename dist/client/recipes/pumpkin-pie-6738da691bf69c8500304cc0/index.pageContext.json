This initial high temperature helps to set the crust and gives it a nice golden color."},{"name":"Mix the Filling","description":"In a large mixing bowl, combine the 1 can (15 oz) of pumpkin puree, 1 can (14 oz) of sweetened condensed milk, 2 eggs, 3/4 cup of sugar, 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, 1/2 tsp of ginger, and 1/2 tsp of salt. Use a whisk or electric mixer to blend until smooth. Make sure there are no lumps for a creamy texture."},{"name":"Prepare the Pie Crust","description":"Take your 9-inch store-bought pie crust and place it in a pie dish. If using a frozen crust, allow it to thaw according to package instructions. Be careful not to stretch the crust when fitting it into the dish."},{"name":"Fill the Pie Crust","description":"Pour the prepared pumpkin filling into the crust, using a spatula to spread it evenly. This ensures that the filling bakes uniformly."},{"name":"Bake at High Temperature","description":"Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake at 425°F (220°C) for 15 minutes. This step is crucial for setting the crust."},{"name":"Reduce Temperature and Continue Baking","description":"After 15 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (175°C) and continue baking for an additional 40-45 minutes. Check for doneness by inserting a knife into the center. If it comes out clean, the pie is finished."},{"name":"Cool and Serve","description":"Once baked, remove the pie from the oven and let it cool completely on a wire rack. This will help the filling to set properly before slicing. Once cooled, slice and serve."}],"pairings":{"pairings":"Pair the pumpkin pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream to enhance its creamy texture and add a sweet contrast. For beverages, consider serving with spiced chai tea, a glass of sweet dessert wine, or a rich coffee to complement the pie's warm spices. If you're looking for a savory contrast, a slice of sharp cheddar cheese can also work surprisingly well.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the pumpkin pie at room temperature or slightly warmed for the best flavor experience. Garnish with a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg on top of the whipped cream for an elegant touch. Consider presenting it on a festive platter with seasonal decorations like cinnamon sticks or small pumpkins to enhance the fall aesthetic. For gatherings, slice the pie into smaller portions for easy serving.","dietary_considerations":"For a gluten-free option, use a gluten-free pie crust or make a crustless pumpkin pie. To reduce sugar, use a sugar substitute suitable for baking. For a dairy-free version, substitute sweetened condensed milk with coconut milk or a dairy-free alternative. Additionally, vegan options can be made by using flax eggs in place of regular eggs and ensuring the pie crust is free from animal products."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I measure ingredients accurately?","answer":"Use dry measuring cups for solids (like sugar) and liquid measuring cups for liquids (like condensed milk). Fill the dry cup to the top and level it off with a straight edge. For liquids, fill to the desired measurement line while checking at eye level."},{"question":"What should I do if my pie crust cracks?","answer":"If your pie crust cracks, don’t worry! You can patch it with leftover dough or simply press it back together. To prevent cracking, ensure you handle the dough gently and keep it chilled."},{"question":"How do I know when the pumpkin pie is done baking?","answer":"Insert a knife or toothpick into the center of the pie. If it comes out clean or with just a few moist crumbs, the pie is done. It may still wobble slightly in the center but will firm up as it cools."},{"question":"What’s the best way to cool my pumpkin pie?","answer":"Let your pie cool at room temperature for about 2 hours before slicing. This helps the filling set properly. Avoid refrigerating while it’s warm as it can lead to a soggy crust."},{"question":"Can I use fresh pumpkin instead of canned puree?","answer":"Yes, you can! To use fresh pumpkin, roast it until soft, scoop out the flesh, and blend until smooth. You'll need about 2 cups of fresh pumpkin for this recipe."},{"question":"What spices can I substitute if I don’t have ginger or nutmeg?","answer":"If you don’t have ginger, you can use allspice or simply omit it. For nutmeg, a pinch of cinnamon can work as a substitute, although it will alter the flavor slightly."},{"question":"How can I prevent my pie from getting soggy?","answer":"To prevent a soggy crust, bake the crust for about 10 minutes before adding the filling (blind baking). This helps set the crust before adding the moist filling."},{"question":"Is it necessary to use sweetened condensed milk?","answer":"Sweetened condensed milk is key for the creamy texture and sweetness of the pie. If you need a substitute, you could use evaporated milk with an additional 1/3 cup of sugar, but the flavor will vary."},{"question":"What should I do if I burn the edges of my pie crust?","answer":"If the edges start to burn, cover them with aluminum foil to shield them from the heat while the rest of the pie continues to bake."},{"question":"Can I make the pie ahead of time?","answer":"Absolutely! You can bake the pie a day or two in advance. Store it covered in the refrigerator. Just remember to let it come to room temperature before serving for the best flavor."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"pumpkin puree","advice":"Use canned pumpkin puree for convenience, but if you prefer fresh, roast a small pumpkin, scoop out the flesh, and blend until smooth. If you want a richer flavor, consider adding a pinch of smoked paprika."},{"name":"sweetened condensed milk","advice":"If you want a dairy-free option, use coconut cream or a homemade version by simmering coconut milk with sugar until thickened. Adjust sweetness as needed."},{"name":"eggs","advice":"For a vegan alternative, you can replace each egg with 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce or a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 2.5 tablespoons water, let sit until gel-like)."},{"name":"sugar","advice":"You can substitute granulated sugar with brown sugar for a deeper flavor, or use maple syrup for a more natural sweetness. Adjust the liquid content if using liquid sweeteners."},{"name":"cinnamon","advice":"For a bolder flavor, consider using Ceylon cinnamon instead of Cassia cinnamon. You can also add a little extra for enhanced warmth."},{"name":"nutmeg","advice":"Freshly grated nutmeg offers a more potent flavor than pre-ground. If you're out of nutmeg, allspice can be a good substitute."},{"name":"ginger","advice":"If you have fresh ginger, use about 1 teaspoon of finely grated fresh ginger instead of dried for a brighter flavor. You can also add a touch of ground cloves for added warmth."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Don't skip the salt; it enhances the sweetness. You can use sea salt or kosher salt based on your preference. A pinch of flaky sea salt on top before serving can elevate the flavor."},{"name":"pie crust","advice":"Store-bought crust is convenient, but feel free to make your own using butter, flour, and a bit of salt for a flakier texture. If gluten-free, look for a gluten-free pie crust or make one with almond flour."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"6738da691bf69c8500304cc0","name":"Pumpkin Pie","ingredients":[{"name":"pumpkin puree","quantity":"1 can (15 oz)","_id":"6738da6c1bf69c8500304cd6"},{"name":"sweetened condensed milk","quantity":"1 can (14 oz)","_id":"6738da6c1bf69c8500304cd7"},{"name":"eggs","quantity":"2","_id":"6738da6c1bf69c8500304cd8"},{"name":"sugar","quantity":"3/4 cup","_id":"6738da6c1bf69c8500304cd9"},{"name":"cinnamon","quantity":"1 tsp","_id":"6738da6c1bf69c8500304cda"},{"name":"nutmeg","quantity":"1/2 tsp","_id":"6738da6c1bf69c8500304cdb"},{"name":"ginger","quantity":"1/2 tsp","_id":"6738da6c1bf69c8500304cdc"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"1/2 tsp","_id":"6738da6c1bf69c8500304cdd"},{"name":"pie crust","quantity":"1 (9-inch) store-bought","_id":"6738da6c1bf69c8500304cde"}],"calories":320,"allergens":["Eggs","Dairy"],"dietaryTags":["Vegetarian"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":10,"preparationTime":15,"cookingTime":60,"tags":["Dessert","Fall","Easy","Classic"],"quickTastyDescription":"A classic fall dessert with a smooth, spiced pumpkin filling in a flaky crust.","detailedCookingInstructions":["Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).","In a large bowl, combine the pumpkin puree, sweetened condensed milk, eggs, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and salt.
