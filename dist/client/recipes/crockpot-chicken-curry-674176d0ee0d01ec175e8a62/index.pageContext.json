For a fresh contrast, consider serving it with a crisp cucumber salad dressed in vinegar or yogurt. If you're looking to add a protein element, grilled shrimp or tandoori chicken can complement this dish beautifully. For beverages, a crisp white wine such as Sauvignon Blanc or a light lager would enhance the meal, while a mango lassi offers a traditional non-alcoholic option that balances the spices.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the chicken curry in deep bowls with a generous ladle of sauce, topped with fresh cilantro for a pop of color and flavor.

Simply trim any excess fat and cut them into large chunks if desired.

Just sprinkle a handful on top before serving for a beautiful presentation!"}],"ingredients":[{"name":"chicken breast or thighs","advice":"Both chicken breast and thighs work well, but thighs are juicier and more forgiving if overcooked. If you prefer a leaner option, use breast. For a vegetarian alternative, try using chickpeas or tofu, but adjust cooking times accordingly."},{"name":"coconut milk","advice":"Coconut milk adds creaminess and richness. For a lighter version, use light coconut milk or a blend of coconut milk and vegetable broth. If you're allergic to coconut, try using cashew cream or almond milk, but the flavor will differ."},{"name":"curry powder","advice":"Curry powder varies in flavor and heat; taste it before adding to adjust to your liking.
