For this recipe, simply pour 4 cups of broth into a medium pot and bring it to a boil."},{"question":"What is the best way to beat eggs?","answer":"Use a whisk or a fork to beat the eggs in a separate bowl until the yolks and whites are fully combined. This will help create those beautiful ribbons when you drizzle them into the broth."},{"question":"Why do I need to mix cornstarch with water before adding it to the broth?","answer":"Mixing cornstarch with water (this is called a slurry) helps it dissolve evenly without clumping when added to the hot broth.
