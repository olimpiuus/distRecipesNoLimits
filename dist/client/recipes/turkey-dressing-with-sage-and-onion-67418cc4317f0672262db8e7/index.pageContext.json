Just make sure it's dried out; you can leave it out overnight or toast it lightly."},{"question":"How do I chop an onion without crying?","answer":"To minimize tears, try chilling the onion in the fridge before cutting, or use a sharp knife. Cutting the root end last can also help reduce the release of tear-inducing compounds."},{"question":"What if I don’t have fresh sage?","answer":"If you don’t have fresh sage, you can use dried sage. Use about one teaspoon of dried sage for every tablespoon of fresh sage, but remember that dried herbs are more concentrated."},{"question":"How do I know when the vegetables are done sautéing?","answer":"The vegetables should be soft and translucent. For onions, look for a slightly golden color, which means they are caramelizing and bringing out their natural sweetness."},{"question":"Can I prepare the dressing a day in advance?","answer":"Yes!

It may need a few extra minutes in the oven if it's cold."},{"question":"What can I use instead of chicken broth?","answer":"You can substitute chicken broth with vegetable broth for a vegetarian option. You can also use water, but it may lack the depth of flavor."},{"question":"How do I know when the dressing is done baking?","answer":"Look for a golden brown color on top, and if you insert a fork or knife, it should come out clean. The dressing should be firm but moist inside."},{"question":"How can I safely handle hot pans in the oven?","answer":"Always use oven mitts when handling hot pans. Make sure your mitts are dry, as wet materials can conduct heat and cause burns. Also, keep a clear pathway to avoid accidents."},{"question":"What should I do if the dressing is too dry?","answer":"If you find the dressing is too dry after baking, you can drizzle a bit more broth over the top. Return it to the oven for a few more minutes to soak in the moisture."},{"question":"Can I add other ingredients to the dressing?","answer":"Absolutely! Feel free to add ingredients like cooked sausage, nuts, or dried fruits for extra flavor and texture. Just make sure not to overpower the sage and onion."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"dried bread cubes","advice":"Use stale or day-old bread for the best texture. If you don't have dried bread cubes, you can cube fresh bread and toast it in the oven at 300°F (150°C) for about 15-20 minutes until dry. For a gluten-free option, use gluten-free bread."},{"name":"onion, chopped","advice":"Yellow onions are great for this recipe, but you can also use shallots for a sweeter flavor or red onions for a bit of color. If you want a milder taste, sauté the onion longer until it caramelizes."},{"name":"celery, chopped","advice":"Celery adds a nice crunch and flavor. If you don’t have celery, you can substitute with chopped bell peppers or leeks. For added depth, consider adding a bit of fennel for a slight anise flavor."},{"name":"fresh sage, chopped","advice":"Fresh sage is ideal, but if you only have dried sage, use about 1 tablespoon, as it's more concentrated. You could also mix in other herbs like thyme or rosemary for additional flavors."},{"name":"chicken broth","advice":"For a richer flavor, use homemade chicken broth if available. Vegetable broth can be a great substitute for a vegetarian version. For a deeper taste, consider adding a splash of white wine to the broth."},{"name":"butter","advice":"Butter adds richness, but you can substitute with olive oil or a dairy-free butter alternative for a vegan option.
