Perfect for parties or a tasty snack!","cookingSteps":[{"name":"Prepare the Corn","description":"If using frozen corn, add 2 cups to a skillet over medium heat. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until heated through. If using canned corn, simply drain and rinse it under cold water to remove excess sodium."},{"name":"Mix the Base","description":"In a large mixing bowl, combine 8 oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup sour cream, and 1/4 cup mayonnaise. Use a hand mixer or a whisk to blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy. This is crucial for ensuring that the dip has a velvety texture."},{"name":"Incorporate the Corn and Seasonings","description":"To the creamy mixture, add the cooked corn, 1/2 cup Cotija cheese, 2 tbsp lime juice, 1 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir gently but thoroughly until everything is evenly combined."},{"name":"Transfer to Baking Dish","description":"Scoop the corn mixture into a baking dish, spreading it out evenly. This ensures that it heats through uniformly and that every scoop has the same great flavor."},{"name":"Bake the Dip","description":"Place the baking dish in a preheated oven set to 350°F (175°C). Bake for about 10-15 minutes, or until the dip is bubbly and the top is slightly golden.

You might also enhance the experience with grilled chicken or shrimp skewers seasoned with lime and chili. For beverages, classic options include margaritas, Mexican lagers, or a chilled white sangria with citrus notes. If you prefer non-alcoholic options, try refreshing aguas frescas or a lime-infused sparkling water.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the Mexican Street Corn Dip warm, straight from the oven, in a colorful ceramic baking dish for an inviting presentation. Garnish with additional chopped cilantro and a sprinkle of chili powder or extra Cotija cheese to add visual appeal. Provide a variety of dipping options, such as blue corn tortilla chips, sliced radishes, and cucumber sticks, to cater to different tastes. For a festive touch, arrange the chips in a decorative bowl and serve with lime wedges on the side for an extra burst of flavor.","dietary_considerations":"For a lighter version, consider using Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and mayonnaise. To make it gluten-free, ensure that your tortilla chips are certified gluten-free. For a vegan option, replace cream cheese with a plant-based cream cheese alternative, use vegan sour cream, and omit the Cotija cheese or substitute it with a vegan cheese option. Additionally, check that any packaged ingredients like tortilla chips are free from animal products."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I prepare corn for this dip?","answer":"If using frozen corn, simply cook it in a skillet over medium heat for about 5-7 minutes until heated through. For canned corn, make sure to drain and rinse it before adding it to the mix. This will help remove excess salt and keep the dip fresh."},{"question":"What should I do if my cream cheese is too hard to mix?","answer":"Let your cream cheese sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes before you start. If you're in a hurry, you can microwave it for about 10-15 seconds to soften it slightly. Just be careful not to melt it!"},{"question":"Can I use a substitute for Cotija cheese?","answer":"Yes! If you can't find Cotija cheese, you can substitute it with feta cheese or queso fresco, both of which have similar flavors and textures."},{"question":"How can I adjust the spice level of the dip?","answer":"To make the dip milder, you can reduce the amount of chili powder or omit it altogether. If you like it spicier, consider adding a pinch of cayenne pepper or some diced jalapeños."},{"question":"What if I don't have fresh cilantro?","answer":"If fresh cilantro is unavailable, you can use dried cilantro or parsley as a substitute. Just keep in mind that dried herbs are more concentrated, so use about one-third of the amount."},{"question":"How can I tell when the dip is done baking?","answer":"The dip is ready when it is bubbly and the top has a slightly golden color, usually after about 10-15 minutes in a 350°F (175°C) oven."},{"question":"What can I serve with this dip?","answer":"Tortilla chips are a classic choice for serving with this dip, but you can also use fresh veggies like carrot sticks, cucumber slices, or bell pepper strips for a healthier option."},{"question":"Can I make this dip ahead of time?","answer":"Absolutely! You can prepare the mixture a day in advance and store it in the refrigerator. Just remember to bake it right before serving for the best texture and flavor."},{"question":"How do I safely handle and cook with hot ingredients?","answer":"Always use oven mitts when handling hot dishes, and be cautious when stirring hot mixtures to avoid splashes. Let dishes cool slightly before touching them."},{"question":"What is the best way to store leftovers?","answer":"Store any leftover dip in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving again."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"corn (frozen or canned)","advice":"If using frozen corn, sauté it in a skillet with a bit of olive oil or butter for added flavor and to enhance the sweetness. For canned corn, opt for low-sodium varieties to control salt levels. You can also substitute with fresh corn when in season; just cut the kernels off the cob and blanch them briefly before adding."},{"name":"cream cheese","advice":"Let the cream cheese soften at room temperature for easier mixing. If you're looking for a lighter option, you can substitute with Greek yogurt or a lower-fat cream cheese. For a tangier flavor, try using herbed cream cheese."},{"name":"sour cream","advice":"Choose full-fat sour cream for a richer flavor, but you can substitute with Greek yogurt for a healthier twist. For added flavor, consider using a flavored sour cream, such as chipotle, or mix in some lime zest."},{"name":"mayonnaise","advice":"Use a high-quality mayonnaise for the best flavor. If you're avoiding mayonnaise, you can substitute with avocado or a vegan mayo for a healthier option. Adding a dash of mustard can enhance the dip's tanginess."},{"name":"cotija cheese","advice":"Cotija provides a salty, crumbly texture. If unavailable, feta cheese makes a great substitute, though it's saltier. For a milder flavor, you can also use ricotta or goat cheese."},{"name":"lime juice","advice":"Fresh lime juice is ideal for the best flavor; bottled lime juice can be used in a pinch but may lack the freshness.

You can substitute with smoked paprika for a smoky flavor or use a blend of cumin and cayenne for a different spice profile."},{"name":"garlic powder","advice":"For a fresher taste, consider using minced garlic instead, but use less (1/2 to 1 clove) as it's stronger. If you prefer a milder flavor, reduce the garlic powder amount."},{"name":"cilantro (chopped)","advice":"Fresh cilantro adds brightness; however, if you're not a fan, fresh parsley can be used as a substitute. To enhance the flavor, consider adding a pinch of cilantro stems, which are more flavorful."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Use salt to taste, but be cautious if you're using salty ingredients like Cotija cheese. Instead of table salt, consider using kosher salt for better flavor distribution."},{"name":"pepper","advice":"Freshly cracked black pepper provides the best flavor. You can also experiment with white pepper or even a pinch of cayenne for added heat."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673ab3e0edc2108ede2a91ae","name":"Mexican Street Corn Dip","ingredients":[{"name":"corn (frozen or canned)","quantity":"2 cups","_id":"673ab3e3edc2108ede2a91bb"},{"name":"cream cheese","quantity":"8 oz","_id":"673ab3e3edc2108ede2a91bc"},{"name":"sour cream","quantity":"1/2 cup","_id":"673ab3e3edc2108ede2a91bd"},{"name":"mayonnaise","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"673ab3e3edc2108ede2a91be"},{"name":"cotija cheese","quantity":"1/2 cup","_id":"673ab3e3edc2108ede2a91bf"},{"name":"lime juice","quantity":"2 tbsp","_id":"673ab3e3edc2108ede2a91c0"},{"name":"chili powder","quantity":"1 tsp","_id":"673ab3e3edc2108ede2a91c1"},{"name":"garlic powder","quantity":"1/2 tsp","_id":"673ab3e3edc2108ede2a91c2"},{"name":"cilantro (chopped)","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"673ab3e3edc2108ede2a91c3"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673ab3e3edc2108ede2a91c4"},{"name":"pepper","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673ab3e3edc2108ede2a91c5"}],"calories":250,"allergens":["Dairy"],"dietaryTags":["Vegetarian"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":10,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":15,"tags":["Dip","Appetizer","Party Food"],"quickTastyDescription":"Creamy, zesty dip inspired by street corn, packed with flavor and perfect for sharing!","detailedCookingInstructions":["If using frozen corn, cook it in a skillet over medium heat until heated through (about 5-7 minutes).
