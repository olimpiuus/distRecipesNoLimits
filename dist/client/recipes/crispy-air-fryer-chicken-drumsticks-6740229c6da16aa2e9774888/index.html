If you need a healthier option, you can remove the skin, but this will reduce crispiness. For a flavorful twist, consider marinating the drumsticks in your favorite spices or sauces for a few hours or overnight.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">olive oil</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Olive oil enhances the flavor and helps achieve crispiness. If you&#x27;re out of olive oil, you can substitute it with other oils like avocado oil or canola oil, which also have a high smoke point. For flavor enhancement, try infusing your olive oil with herbs or garlic before using it.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">garlic powder</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Garlic powder adds a nice depth of flavor. If you don’t have garlic powder, you can use fresh minced garlic, but reduce the amount to about 1/2 to 1 clove as it can be more potent. Alternatively, granulated garlic can also be used.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">paprika</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Paprika adds color and a mild flavor. You can use smoked paprika for a smoky flavor, or sweet paprika for a milder taste. If you only have cayenne pepper, use it sparingly to avoid too much heat, as it&#x27;s much spicier.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">salt</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Salt is crucial for enhancing the flavors of the chicken. If you&#x27;re watching your sodium intake, you can use a salt substitute or reduce the amount of salt. Consider using flavored salts, like garlic salt or herb-infused salt, for an additional flavor boost.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">black pepper</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Freshly ground black pepper provides a warm and spicy flavor. If you don&#x27;t have black pepper, you can substitute it with white pepper, which has a slightly different flavor profile but works well in most dishes. For a different twist, try using crushed red pepper flakes for added heat.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">onion powder</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Onion powder adds a sweet and savory flavor. If you don’t have onion powder, you can substitute with fresh onion, but use it sparingly as it will impart more moisture. Alternatively, shallot powder or even leeks can provide a similar flavor.</p></div></div></section><section class="mb-12 text-justify"><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8 text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500 to-orange-600">Cooking Steps</h2><ul class="space-y-6"><li id="coocking-step-preheat-the-air-fryer" class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-orange-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-800">Step <!-- -->1<!-- -->: <span class="text-orange-600">Preheat the Air Fryer</span></h3><div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span>Begin by preheating your air fryer to 400°F (200°C).

If you need a healthier option, you can remove the skin, but this will reduce crispiness. For a flavorful twist, consider marinating the drumsticks in your favorite spices or sauces for a few hours or overnight."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Olive oil enhances the flavor and helps achieve crispiness. If you're out of olive oil, you can substitute it with other oils like avocado oil or canola oil, which also have a high smoke point. For flavor enhancement, try infusing your olive oil with herbs or garlic before using it."},{"name":"garlic powder","advice":"Garlic powder adds a nice depth of flavor. If you don’t have garlic powder, you can use fresh minced garlic, but reduce the amount to about 1/2 to 1 clove as it can be more potent. Alternatively, granulated garlic can also be used."},{"name":"paprika","advice":"Paprika adds color and a mild flavor. You can use smoked paprika for a smoky flavor, or sweet paprika for a milder taste.

If you don't have black pepper, you can substitute it with white pepper, which has a slightly different flavor profile but works well in most dishes. For a different twist, try using crushed red pepper flakes for added heat."},{"name":"onion powder","advice":"Onion powder adds a sweet and savory flavor. If you don’t have onion powder, you can substitute with fresh onion, but use it sparingly as it will impart more moisture.
