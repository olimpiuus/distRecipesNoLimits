Perfect for busy nights, these flavorful drumsticks are quick to prepare and packed with taste!","cookingSteps":[{"name":"Preheat the Air Fryer","description":"Begin by preheating your air fryer to 400°F (200°C). Preheating is essential for achieving that perfect crispiness on your chicken drumsticks. It ensures that the chicken starts cooking immediately when placed inside, promoting even cooking."},{"name":"Prepare the Seasoning Mixture","description":"In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of paprika, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, and 1 teaspoon of onion powder. Mix these ingredients well until they form a smooth paste. This seasoning blend will not only flavor the chicken but also help in achieving a crispy texture."},{"name":"Coat the Chicken Drumsticks","description":"Add the 8 pieces of chicken drumsticks to the bowl with the seasoning mixture. Toss the drumsticks in the mixture until they are evenly coated. Make sure every piece is well covered for maximum flavor. Tip: For a deeper flavor, let the seasoned drumsticks marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight."},{"name":"Arrange in Air Fryer Basket","description":"Carefully place the seasoned chicken drumsticks in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Avoid overcrowding to ensure proper air circulation. If your air fryer is small, consider cooking in batches. Note: If you have a larger air fryer, you can fit all 8 drumsticks at once."},{"name":"Cook the Drumsticks","description":"Set the timer for 25 minutes and let the drumsticks cook, turning them halfway through the cooking time. Use tongs to flip the chicken, which helps achieve an even golden brown color on all sides. Tip: Use a meat thermometer to check that the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F (75°C) to ensure it is fully cooked."},{"name":"Rest and Serve","description":"Once cooked, carefully remove the chicken drumsticks from the air fryer and allow them to rest for a few minutes before serving. This resting period helps the juices redistribute throughout the meat, resulting in a juicier and tastier bite. Serve with your favorite dipping sauce or side."}],"pairings":{"pairings":"These crispy air fryer chicken drumsticks pair beautifully with a variety of sides and beverages. Consider serving with a fresh coleslaw or a side of roasted vegetables like carrots and Brussels sprouts, which offer a sweet and earthy contrast to the savory chicken. For a starch, garlic mashed potatoes or a light quinoa salad would complement the dish well. As for beverages, a chilled lager or a refreshing iced tea would enhance the meal, while a light red wine, such as Pinot Noir, offers a nice balance to the seasoning.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the chicken drumsticks hot, garnished with fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro to add a pop of color and freshness. You can also drizzle a squeeze of lemon juice over them for an acidic contrast that brightens the flavors. For a fun presentation, arrange the drumsticks on a large platter, and serve with a selection of dipping sauces such as honey mustard, BBQ sauce, or a spicy sriracha mayo. This makes for an interactive dining experience where guests can customize their flavors.","dietary_considerations":"This recipe is naturally gluten-free and can easily be made low-carb. For those with dietary restrictions, consider using skinless chicken drumsticks to reduce fat content. If you're looking for a spicier version, feel free to add cayenne pepper or chili powder to the seasoning mix. For a vegetarian alternative, grilled or air-fried cauliflower wings can be seasoned similarly, providing a satisfying crunch and flavor."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I prepare chicken drumsticks before cooking them?","answer":"Start by rinsing the chicken drumsticks under cold water and patting them dry with paper towels. This helps to remove any residue and moisture. Removing excess moisture will help the skin get crispy in the air fryer."},{"question":"What if I don’t have all the spices listed?","answer":"No worries! You can use any seasoning blend you have on hand. Just make sure to include some form of salt and pepper for flavor. Italian seasoning or a BBQ rub can also work well as substitutes."},{"question":"How do I know when the chicken is cooked through?","answer":"The best way to check if chicken is cooked is by using a meat thermometer. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (75°C). If you don’t have one, ensure the juices run clear when you cut into the thickest part of the drumstick."},{"question":"Can I use frozen chicken drumsticks?","answer":"Yes, you can use frozen chicken drumsticks, but they will require a longer cooking time. Ensure they are fully thawed before seasoning to help the spices adhere better."},{"question":"What should I do if my air fryer doesn't fit all the drumsticks?","answer":"If your air fryer is small, cook the drumsticks in batches. Make sure to arrange them in a single layer for even cooking, and simply keep the cooked ones warm in a low oven (around 200°F or 93°C) while you finish the rest."},{"question":"How do I clean my air fryer after cooking?","answer":"Let the air fryer cool down completely. Then, remove the basket and tray and wash them with warm, soapy water or place them in the dishwasher if they are dishwasher-safe. Wipe down the interior with a damp cloth."},{"question":"Why is it important to let the chicken rest after cooking?","answer":"Letting the chicken rest for a few minutes allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, making it more tender and juicy when you bite into it."},{"question":"Can I make this recipe in the oven instead?","answer":"Yes, you can use the oven! Preheat it to 425°F (220°C) and place the seasoned drumsticks on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for about 35-40 minutes, turning halfway through, until they are golden and cooked through."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"chicken drumsticks","advice":"Look for drumsticks with the skin on for the crispiest results in the air fryer. If you need a healthier option, you can remove the skin, but this will reduce crispiness. For a flavorful twist, consider marinating the drumsticks in your favorite spices or sauces for a few hours or overnight."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Olive oil enhances the flavor and helps achieve crispiness. If you're out of olive oil, you can substitute it with other oils like avocado oil or canola oil, which also have a high smoke point. For flavor enhancement, try infusing your olive oil with herbs or garlic before using it."},{"name":"garlic powder","advice":"Garlic powder adds a nice depth of flavor. If you don’t have garlic powder, you can use fresh minced garlic, but reduce the amount to about 1/2 to 1 clove as it can be more potent. Alternatively, granulated garlic can also be used."},{"name":"paprika","advice":"Paprika adds color and a mild flavor. You can use smoked paprika for a smoky flavor, or sweet paprika for a milder taste. If you only have cayenne pepper, use it sparingly to avoid too much heat, as it's much spicier."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Salt is crucial for enhancing the flavors of the chicken. If you're watching your sodium intake, you can use a salt substitute or reduce the amount of salt. Consider using flavored salts, like garlic salt or herb-infused salt, for an additional flavor boost."},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly ground black pepper provides a warm and spicy flavor. If you don't have black pepper, you can substitute it with white pepper, which has a slightly different flavor profile but works well in most dishes. For a different twist, try using crushed red pepper flakes for added heat."},{"name":"onion powder","advice":"Onion powder adds a sweet and savory flavor. If you don’t have onion powder, you can substitute with fresh onion, but use it sparingly as it will impart more moisture. Alternatively, shallot powder or even leeks can provide a similar flavor."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"6740229c6da16aa2e9774888","name":"Crispy Air Fryer Chicken Drumsticks","ingredients":[{"name":"chicken drumsticks","quantity":"8 pieces","_id":"6740229f6da16aa2e9774897"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"6740229f6da16aa2e9774898"},{"name":"garlic powder","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"6740229f6da16aa2e9774899"},{"name":"paprika","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"6740229f6da16aa2e977489a"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"6740229f6da16aa2e977489b"},{"name":"black pepper","quantity":"1/2 teaspoon","_id":"6740229f6da16aa2e977489c"},{"name":"onion powder","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"6740229f6da16aa2e977489d"}],"calories":350,"allergens":[],"dietaryTags":["gluten-free","high-protein"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":10,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":25,"tags":["easy","quick","air fryer","chicken"],"quickTastyDescription":"Deliciously crispy chicken drumsticks cooked in the air fryer for a healthier twist on a classic favorite!","detailedCookingInstructions":["Preheat the air fryer to 400°F (200°C).","In a large bowl, combine olive oil, garlic powder, paprika, salt, black pepper, and onion powder.","Add the chicken drumsticks to the bowl and toss until they are well coated with the seasoning mixture.","Arrange the drumsticks in a single layer in the air fryer basket.
