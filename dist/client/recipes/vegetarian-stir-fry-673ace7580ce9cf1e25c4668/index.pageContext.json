For bell peppers, slice them into thin strips; for broccoli, cut florets into bite-sized pieces; slice the carrot into thin rounds or matchsticks; and trim the ends of the snap peas. Cutting everything uniformly helps them cook evenly."},{"question":"How do I know when my vegetables are done cooking?","answer":"Vegetables should be vibrant in color and tender-crisp. You want them to have some bite, so they should not be mushy. Typically, stir-frying for 5-7 minutes should suffice, but keep an eye on the texture."},{"question":"Is it safe to use a high cooking temperature?","answer":"Yes, using medium-high heat is essential for stir-frying. It allows the vegetables to cook quickly while retaining their color and texture. Just be sure to stir continuously to prevent burning."},{"question":"What can I substitute for soy sauce if I want a gluten-free option?","answer":"You can use tamari, which is a gluten-free soy sauce alternative. Alternatively, coconut aminos can work well and offer a slightly sweeter flavor."},{"question":"How can I make my stir-fry more flavorful?","answer":"In addition to soy sauce, consider adding ginger, chili flakes, or a splash of rice vinegar for extra depth. Experimenting with fresh herbs or spices can also elevate the dish."},{"question":"Can I add protein to my vegetarian stir-fry?","answer":"Absolutely! You can add tofu, tempeh, or even chickpeas to increase the protein content. If using tofu, make sure to press it to remove excess moisture and cut it into cubes before cooking."},{"question":"What equipment do I need for stir-frying?","answer":"A large skillet or wok is ideal for stir-frying. Ensure it has a wide surface area to allow for even cooking. A wooden spoon or spatula for stirring is also helpful."},{"question":"How do I safely handle hot oil?","answer":"Always heat oil gradually and avoid splashing. Use a splatter guard if you have one, and keep a safe distance from the pan. If you see smoke, reduce the heat immediately."},{"question":"What can I serve with my stir-fry?","answer":"Stir-fry pairs well with rice, quinoa, or noodles. You can also serve it on its own as a light meal or alongside a fresh salad."},{"question":"Can I store leftovers and how should I do it?","answer":"Yes! Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

Red bell peppers are sweeter, while green ones are slightly bitter. If you need a substitute, you can use other sweet peppers or even zucchini for a different texture."},{"name":"broccoli florets","advice":"Look for bright green, firm florets. To enhance the flavor, you can blanch the broccoli quickly in boiling water before adding it to the stir-fry. If you don't have broccoli, cauliflower or green beans can be good alternatives."},{"name":"carrot","advice":"Choose firm, vibrant carrots. For even cooking, slice them thinly or julienne them. If you have baby carrots, they can be used whole or halved. If you want a sweet flavor, consider adding shredded carrots."},{"name":"snap peas","advice":"Select crisp, bright green snap peas. They should snap easily when bent. If unavailable, you can substitute with sugar snap peas or even thinly sliced green beans."},{"name":"soy sauce","advice":"Use low-sodium soy sauce for a healthier option, or tamari for a gluten-free alternative. For a different flavor profile, consider using coconut aminos or liquid aminos."},{"name":"garlic","advice":"Fresh garlic is best; use a garlic press for even mincing. If you don't have fresh garlic, garlic powder can be used (1/8 teaspoon per clove). Roasting the garlic before adding it can also enhance its sweetness."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Extra virgin olive oil adds flavor, but you can substitute with sesame oil for a more traditional stir-fry taste, or canola oil for a neutral flavor. Make sure the oil is hot before adding vegetables to achieve that nice sear."},{"name":"sesame seeds (optional)","advice":"Toasting sesame seeds before sprinkling them on will enhance their nutty flavor. If you don’t have sesame seeds, crushed peanuts or sunflower seeds can provide a nice crunch."},{"name":"green onions (for garnish)","advice":"Choose firm, green onions with no wilting.
