If you don’t have quinoa, you can substitute with millet or rice, but keep in mind that the flavor and texture will differ.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">cucumber</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Choose firm cucumbers for the best texture. If using a larger cucumber, consider peeling it and removing the seeds to avoid excess moisture in the salad. For a different flavor profile, try substituting with diced zucchini or even avocado.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">cherry tomatoes</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Select ripe cherry tomatoes for a burst of sweetness. You can substitute with grape tomatoes or even diced regular tomatoes if necessary, but ensure they are firm to maintain structure in the salad.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">red bell pepper</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Red bell peppers are sweet and add vibrant color. If you want a different flavor, you could use yellow or orange bell peppers, or for a bit of heat, consider using jalapeño or a diced serrano pepper.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">red onion</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Finely chopping red onion reduces its sharpness, making it milder. Soaking the chopped onion in cold water for 10 minutes before adding it to the salad can also help mellow the flavor. If you prefer, you can substitute with green onions for a milder taste.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">fresh parsley</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Use fresh parsley for the best flavor; flat-leaf parsley (Italian parsley) is preferred for its stronger taste. If you have cilantro on hand, it can be used as a substitute, but it will change the flavor profile significantly.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">olive oil</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Choose a high-quality extra virgin olive oil for the best flavor. If you&#x27;re looking for a substitute, avocado oil or a light grapeseed oil can work, but they have different flavor notes.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">lemon juice</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Freshly squeezed lemon juice is preferable for its vibrant flavor. If you don’t have fresh lemons, bottled lemon juice can be used, but it may not be as bright. Lime juice can also be a great substitute for a different twist.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">salt</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Use sea salt or kosher salt for better flavor control. Start with a small amount and adjust to taste as you mix the ingredients, ensuring you don’t over-salt.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">pepper</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Freshly cracked black pepper adds a nice kick to the salad. For a different flavor, consider using white pepper or even a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes for some heat.</p></div></div></section><section class="mb-12 text-justify"><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8 text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500 to-orange-600">Cooking Steps</h2><ul class="space-y-6"><li id="coocking-step-rinse-the-quinoa" class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-orange-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-800">Step <!-- -->1<!-- -->: <span class="text-orange-600">Rinse the Quinoa</span></h3><div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span>Start by rinsing 1 cup of quinoa under cold water in a fine-mesh strainer.
