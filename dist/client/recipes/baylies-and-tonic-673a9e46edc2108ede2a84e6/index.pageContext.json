Fill the glass with ice cubes, about one cup, to chill the drink properly. Using a larger glass allows for better mixing and presentation."},{"name":"Pour in Baileys Irish Cream","description":"Measure out 1.5 oz of Baileys Irish Cream using a jigger or a measuring cup. Slowly pour the Baileys over the ice. The creamy texture will create a beautiful contrast with the ice. Make sure to pour gently to avoid splashing."},{"name":"Add Tonic Water","description":"Next, take 4 oz of tonic water. Pour it gently over the back of a spoon into the glass, which helps to maintain the layers of the drink. This technique prevents the carbonation from dissipating quickly and keeps your drink bubbly longer."},{"name":"Stir Lightly","description":"Using a long spoon or a straw, stir the drink lightly to combine the Baileys and tonic water. Be careful not to stir too vigorously, as you want to maintain some of the carbonation from the tonic."},{"name":"Garnish and Serve","description":"Finally, take a lime wedge and squeeze a bit of juice into the drink for added flavor. Place the lime wedge on the rim of the glass as a garnish. Serve the drink immediately while it’s cold and refreshing."}],"pairings":{"pairings":"This Baileys and Tonic can be paired wonderfully with light appetizers such as smoked salmon canapés, cheese platters featuring creamy Brie or aged Gouda, or dessert options like chocolate mousse or tiramisu. For a heartier option, consider serving it alongside grilled chicken skewers marinated in citrus flavors or shrimp tacos with a lime crema.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the Baileys and Tonic in a chilled highball glass to maintain its refreshing temperature. Consider adding a few mint leaves for an aromatic touch, and perhaps a sprinkle of cocoa powder or chocolate shavings on top for visual appeal. This drink is perfect for casual gatherings or as a unique dessert cocktail at dinner parties. Serve it with a fun straw or cocktail stirrer to add a playful element.","dietary_considerations":"The Baileys and Tonic is not suitable for those with dairy allergies or lactose intolerance due to the Irish cream.

A sprig of fresh mint can also add a nice touch!"}],"ingredients":[{"name":"baileys irish cream","advice":"Baileys Irish Cream is a rich and creamy liqueur that adds a sweet, velvety texture to drinks.

You can also enhance the flavor by adding a splash of coffee or chocolate syrup."},{"name":"tonic water","advice":"Tonic water adds a refreshing and slightly bitter contrast to the sweetness of Baileys. If you want to reduce sugar, choose a diet tonic water or a low-sugar alternative. You can also experiment with flavored tonic waters, such as cucumber or elderflower, to add an interesting twist."},{"name":"ice","advice":"Use clear, fresh ice cubes for the best presentation and taste.
