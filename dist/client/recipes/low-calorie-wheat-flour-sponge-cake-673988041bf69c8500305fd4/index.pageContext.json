This adds moisture and flavor to your cake."},{"name":"Combine Dry Ingredients","description":"In a separate bowl, sift together 1 cup of whole wheat flour, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and optional 1 teaspoon of lemon zest. Sifting helps to aerate the flour and remove lumps."},{"name":"Fold Dry into Wet Ingredients","description":"Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture using a spatula or wooden spoon. Be careful not to overmix; you want to combine them until just incorporated to keep the cake light and fluffy."},{"name":"Pour and Smooth the Batter","description":"Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and use a spatula to smooth the top. This ensures even cooking and a nice presentation."},{"name":"Bake the Cake","description":"Place the cake in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes.

For a more indulgent touch, consider a light whipped cream made from low-fat cream or Greek yogurt, lightly sweetened with honey or agave syrup. A cup of herbal tea, such as chamomile or mint, complements the cake's subtle sweetness, while a light sparkling water with a splash of lemon offers a refreshing contrast. For a special occasion, serve alongside a scoop of low-calorie vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt for a delightful dessert experience.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the sponge cake at room temperature with a dusting of powdered sugar for a simple yet elegant presentation. Arrange sliced strawberries or a mixed berry compote around the cake for added visual appeal and flavor. For a brunch or tea party, consider slicing the cake into smaller squares for individual portions, garnished with a sprig of mint. If desired, drizzle a light honey glaze over the top just before serving for an extra touch of sweetness without overpowering the cake's natural flavors.","dietary_considerations":"This sponge cake is suitable for those looking for a lower-calorie dessert option. For gluten-free eaters, substitute the whole wheat flour with a gluten-free flour blend. If you're vegan, replace the eggs with a flaxseed meal mixture (1 tablespoon flaxseed meal + 2.5 tablespoons water per egg) and use a plant-based milk. To reduce sugar further, you can adjust the amount of honey or agave syrup, or use a sugar substitute like stevia or erythritol. Ensure that any additional toppings or accompaniments align with the dietary needs of your guests."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I properly measure flour?","answer":"To measure whole wheat flour, use the spoon-and-level method: spoon the flour into your measuring cup without packing it down, and then level off the top with a straight edge. This prevents you from using too much flour, which can make your cake dense."},{"question":"What is the purpose of baking powder in the cake?","answer":"Baking powder is a leavening agent that helps the cake rise and become fluffy. It reacts with moisture and heat to produce carbon dioxide bubbles, which make the cake light and airy."},{"question":"Can I substitute honey with something else?","answer":"Yes! You can use agave syrup, maple syrup, or even a sugar substitute if you prefer. Just keep in mind that different sweeteners may slightly alter the flavor and texture."},{"question":"How do I know when the cake is done baking?","answer":"Insert a toothpick or a knife into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs, the cake is done. If there is wet batter on the toothpick, it needs more time to bake."},{"question":"Why do I need to let the cake cool in the pan?","answer":"Letting the cake cool in the pan for about 10 minutes helps it set and makes it easier to remove without breaking. After that, transferring to a wire rack allows air to circulate around the cake, preventing it from becoming soggy."},{"question":"How can I ensure my cake is moist?","answer":"Make sure not to overmix the batter once you combine the wet and dry ingredients. Overmixing can lead to a tough cake. Also, adding ingredients like applesauce or yogurt can help keep your cake moist."},{"question":"Is it necessary to use lemon zest?","answer":"No, lemon zest is optional. It adds a fresh flavor to the cake, but if you prefer a different flavor or want to keep it simple, you can leave it out."},{"question":"What can I do with leftover egg whites if I'm only using the yolks in this recipe?","answer":"Leftover egg whites can be used in various dishes! You can make meringues, add them to smoothies for extra protein, or whip them into an omelet. Just store them in the fridge for up to a few days."},{"question":"Can I make this cake in advance?","answer":"Yes! You can bake the cake a day or two in advance. Store it in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the fridge for up to a week. Just make sure to let it cool completely before storing."},{"question":"What is the best way to serve this sponge cake?","answer":"This cake is delicious on its own or you can serve it with fresh fruit, yogurt, or a drizzle of honey on top. You can also add a dusting of powdered sugar for a nice presentation!"}],"ingredients":[{"name":"whole wheat flour","advice":"Whole wheat flour adds a nutty flavor and higher fiber content. If you want a lighter texture, you can substitute half with all-purpose flour. Sifting the flour before use can help aerate it, giving the cake a fluffier texture."},{"name":"eggs","advice":"Eggs provide structure and moisture. For a vegan option, you can substitute each egg with 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce or 1/4 cup of silken tofu blended until smooth. Always ensure that eggs are at room temperature for better incorporation."},{"name":"honey or agave syrup","advice":"Both sweeteners will add moisture and sweetness, but honey has a stronger flavor. If you prefer less sweetness, you can reduce the quantity slightly. For a vegan option, stick to agave syrup or maple syrup."},{"name":"baking powder","advice":"Baking powder is essential for leavening. Ensure it's fresh for maximum effectiveness. If you're out of baking powder, you can make a substitute by mixing 1/4 tsp of baking soda with 1/2 tsp of vinegar or lemon juice."},{"name":"milk (low-fat)","advice":"Low-fat milk keeps the cake moist without adding too many calories. If you want a dairy-free option, use almond milk, soy milk, or any nut milk. Make sure to use unsweetened versions to control sweetness."},{"name":"vanilla extract","advice":"Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the cake. You can substitute it with almond extract for a different twist, but use only half the amount as it has a stronger flavor."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Salt is crucial for balancing flavors. If you're watching your sodium intake, consider using a low-sodium salt option or even omitting it, but keep in mind that it can enhance sweetness."},{"name":"lemon zest","advice":"Lemon zest adds a refreshing citrus note. If you don’t have lemons, you can use the zest of oranges or limes as a substitute. Use a microplane to get fine zest without the bitter white pith."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673988041bf69c8500305fd4","name":"Low-Calorie Wheat Flour Sponge Cake","ingredients":[{"name":"whole wheat flour","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673988071bf69c8500305fe1"},{"name":"eggs","quantity":"3 large","_id":"673988071bf69c8500305fe2"},{"name":"honey or agave syrup","quantity":"1/3 cup","_id":"673988071bf69c8500305fe3"},{"name":"baking powder","quantity":"1 tsp","_id":"673988071bf69c8500305fe4"},{"name":"milk (low-fat)","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"673988071bf69c8500305fe5"},{"name":"vanilla extract","quantity":"1 tsp","_id":"673988071bf69c8500305fe6"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"1/4 tsp","_id":"673988071bf69c8500305fe7"},{"name":"lemon zest","quantity":"1 tsp (optional)","_id":"673988071bf69c8500305fe8"}],"calories":120,"allergens":["Eggs"],"dietaryTags":["Low-Calorie","High-Fiber","Vegetarian"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":5,"preparationTime":15,"cookingTime":25,"tags":["Dessert","Easy","Quick"],"quickTastyDescription":"A light and airy sponge cake made with whole wheat flour, perfect for a guilt-free dessert!","detailedCookingInstructions":["Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a round cake pan.","In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and honey until well combined and frothy.","Add the milk and vanilla extract, and mix until smooth.","In a separate bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, baking powder, salt, and lemon zest if using.","Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined.
