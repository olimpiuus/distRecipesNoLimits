Let&#x27;s dive into the recipe!</p><section class="mb-12 text-justify"><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8 text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-gray-700 to-gray-800">Ingredients</h2><div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6"><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">brussels sprouts</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Choose firm, bright green Brussels sprouts that are tightly closed. If they are yellowing or wilting, they may be past their prime. For a more intense flavor, consider roasting them whole instead of halving, though this will take a bit longer. If you can’t find fresh Brussels sprouts, frozen ones can be a good substitute, but they may require different cooking times.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">olive oil</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Extra virgin olive oil is preferred for its flavor, but regular olive oil works too. If you want a different flavor profile, try using avocado oil, which has a high smoke point, or even infused oils like garlic or chili oil for an extra kick. Make sure to coat the sprouts evenly to help them crisp up.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">salt</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Kosher salt is ideal for seasoning vegetables because of its larger grains and ease of dispersal. If you&#x27;re on a low-sodium diet, consider using a salt substitute or reducing the amount of salt used. You can also finish the dish with flaky sea salt for added texture and flavor.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">black pepper</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Freshly ground black pepper will provide a more robust flavor than pre-ground. For a twist, consider adding a pinch of red pepper flakes for heat or using white pepper for a subtler flavor. Be cautious not to overdo it, as the pepper can overwhelm the dish.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">balsamic glaze</h3><p class="text-gray-700">You can buy balsamic glaze or make your own by reducing balsamic vinegar over low heat until it thickens. If you don’t have balsamic glaze, you can substitute with regular balsamic vinegar, but use less and consider adding a bit of honey or maple syrup to mimic the sweetness of glaze. For a different flavor, try using a flavored balsamic vinegar, such as fig or raspberry.</p></div></div></section><section class="mb-12 text-justify"><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8 text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500 to-orange-600">Cooking Steps</h2><ul class="space-y-6"><li id="coocking-step-preheat-the-oven" class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-orange-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-800">Step <!-- -->1<!-- -->: <span class="text-orange-600">Preheat the Oven</span></h3><div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span>Start by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C).

If they are yellowing or wilting, they may be past their prime. For a more intense flavor, consider roasting them whole instead of halving, though this will take a bit longer. If you can’t find fresh Brussels sprouts, frozen ones can be a good substitute, but they may require different cooking times."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Extra virgin olive oil is preferred for its flavor, but regular olive oil works too.

If you're on a low-sodium diet, consider using a salt substitute or reducing the amount of salt used. You can also finish the dish with flaky sea salt for added texture and flavor."},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly ground black pepper will provide a more robust flavor than pre-ground.

Be cautious not to overdo it, as the pepper can overwhelm the dish."},{"name":"balsamic glaze","advice":"You can buy balsamic glaze or make your own by reducing balsamic vinegar over low heat until it thickens.
