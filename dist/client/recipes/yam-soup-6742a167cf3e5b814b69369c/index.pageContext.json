This allows the flavors to meld together."},{"name":"Blend the Soup","description":"Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth.

Grilled chicken or shrimp can also complement the dish if you're looking for added protein. As for beverages, consider serving with a crisp white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc, or a refreshing iced herbal tea to highlight the soup's sweetness and creaminess.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the yam soup in warm bowls to maintain its heat. A drizzle of coconut milk on top adds a beautiful visual element, and a sprinkle of freshly chopped parsley enhances flavor and freshness. For an elegant touch, consider serving with a side of roasted pumpkin seeds for added crunch and nutrition. This soup can also be served in shot glasses as an appetizer for a party or gathering, making it a fun and interactive starter.","dietary_considerations":"This yam soup is naturally vegan and gluten-free, making it suitable for a wide range of dietary preferences. For a lower-fat option, you can substitute light coconut milk or use vegetable broth instead of using coconut milk altogether. Additionally, for those avoiding nightshades, consider omitting the paprika or substituting it with turmeric for a different flavor profile."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I peel and dice yams properly?","answer":"To peel yams, use a vegetable peeler or a knife to remove the skin. Make sure to cut off both ends first for stability. After peeling, cut the yam into even slices, then into strips, and finally into small cubes. This ensures they cook evenly."},{"question":"What can I do if I don’t have an immersion blender?","answer":"If you don’t have an immersion blender, you can transfer the soup in batches to a regular blender. Just be careful not to fill the blender too full to avoid spills. Blend until smooth and then return it to the pot."},{"question":"How do I know when yams are tender?","answer":"Yams are tender when you can easily pierce them with a fork or knife. This usually takes about 20 minutes of simmering, but you can check earlier if they are cut small."},{"question":"What if I don’t have vegetable broth?","answer":"If you don’t have vegetable broth, you can substitute it with water, but consider adding extra seasonings like herbs or spices to enhance the flavor."},{"question":"How can I safely cut onions without crying?","answer":"To minimize tears, chill the onion in the fridge for 30 minutes before cutting, use a sharp knife (which makes cleaner cuts), or cut the onion under running water. Wearing goggles can also help!"},{"question":"What is the best way to store leftover yam soup?","answer":"Let the soup cool completely, then transfer it to an airtight container. It can be refrigerated for up to 4 days or frozen for up to 3 months. Just make sure to leave some space at the top of the container if freezing, as liquids expand."},{"question":"Can I add other vegetables to the yam soup?","answer":"Absolutely! Feel free to add vegetables like carrots, spinach, or bell peppers for added flavor and nutrition. Just ensure they are cut into similar-sized pieces for even cooking."},{"question":"How do I adjust the seasoning if the soup is bland?","answer":"If your soup tastes bland, gradually add salt and pepper, tasting as you go. You can also add a splash of lemon juice or some hot sauce for extra flavor."},{"question":"What is the purpose of the coconut milk?","answer":"Coconut milk adds creaminess and a subtle sweetness to the soup, balancing the earthy flavors of the yams. If you prefer a lighter soup, you can use less coconut milk or substitute it with another type of milk."},{"question":"How can I make my soup thicker?","answer":"To thicken your soup, you can either blend a portion of it to create a creamier texture or add a little cornstarch mixed with water, stirring until it reaches your desired thickness."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"yams","advice":"Choose firm, smooth-skinned yams without any blemishes. If yams are not available, sweet potatoes can be a great substitute, offering a similar texture and sweetness. When peeling, use a vegetable peeler for ease, and make sure to cut them into uniform pieces for even cooking."},{"name":"onion","advice":"For a sweeter flavor, use yellow or sweet onions. If you're short on time, you can use shallots as a substitute. To enhance the flavor, consider caramelizing the onions before adding the garlic for a richer taste."},{"name":"garlic","advice":"Fresh garlic is best for this recipe, but if you don't have any, garlic powder can be used as a substitute (1/8 teaspoon per clove). To enhance the garlic flavor, try roasting it before mincing. This gives it a milder, sweeter flavor."},{"name":"vegetable broth","advice":"Opt for low-sodium vegetable broth to better control the saltiness of your dish. If you don’t have vegetable broth, chicken broth can be used, or you can make your own by simmering vegetables in water. For an umami boost, add a splash of soy sauce or tamari."},{"name":"coconut milk","advice":"Full-fat coconut milk will provide a creamier texture, but low-fat versions can be used if you're looking to reduce calories. If you're allergic to coconut, try using cashew cream or almond milk, but adjust the seasoning as they will be less rich."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Extra virgin olive oil is ideal for its flavor and health benefits. If you're looking for a different flavor, avocado oil or grapeseed oil can work well too. For added richness, you might consider adding a tablespoon of butter if dietary restrictions allow."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Use kosher salt for better control over seasoning. Start with a small amount and adjust to taste as the soup simmers, especially since broth may already contain salt."},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly ground black pepper will provide the best flavor. If you want a bit of spice, consider adding a pinch of cayenne pepper or using white pepper for a different flavor profile."},{"name":"paprika","advice":"Smoked paprika adds a delightful depth and smokiness to the soup, while sweet paprika will enhance the color without the smokiness. If you don’t have paprika, a dash of cayenne or curry powder can add an interesting twist."},{"name":"fresh parsley","advice":"Fresh parsley adds a bright, fresh flavor. If you don't have parsley, consider using cilantro or chives for a different flavor profile. Always add the herbs at the end to preserve their fresh taste."}],"mealId":{"_id":"6742a167cf3e5b814b69369c","name":"Yam Soup","ingredients":[{"name":"yams","quantity":"2 cups, peeled and diced","_id":"6742a16acf3e5b814b6936a8"},{"name":"onion","quantity":"1, chopped","_id":"6742a16acf3e5b814b6936a9"},{"name":"garlic","quantity":"2 cloves, minced","_id":"6742a16acf3e5b814b6936aa"},{"name":"vegetable broth","quantity":"4 cups","_id":"6742a16acf3e5b814b6936ab"},{"name":"coconut milk","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"6742a16acf3e5b814b6936ac"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"6742a16acf3e5b814b6936ad"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"to taste","_id":"6742a16acf3e5b814b6936ae"},{"name":"black pepper","quantity":"to taste","_id":"6742a16acf3e5b814b6936af"},{"name":"paprika","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"6742a16acf3e5b814b6936b0"},{"name":"fresh parsley","quantity":"for garnish","_id":"6742a16acf3e5b814b6936b1"}],"calories":250,"allergens":[],"dietaryTags":["Vegetarian","Gluten-Free"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":10,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":30,"tags":["easy","healthy","comfort food"],"quickTastyDescription":"A creamy and comforting yam soup that is both hearty and easy to make, perfect for any day!","detailedCookingInstructions":["Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.","Add chopped onions and minced garlic, sauté until onions are translucent (about 5 minutes).","Add the diced yams and vegetable broth, bring to a boil.","Reduce heat and simmer for about 20 minutes, until yams are tender.","Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth, or transfer to a blender in batches.","Stir in the coconut milk and season with salt, black pepper, and paprika.","Serve hot, garnished with fresh parsley."],"createdByModel":"4o","baseMeal":"Yam Soup","modifiersForBase":"Coconut milk for creaminess","imageUrl":"/images/yam-soup-6742a167cf3e5b814b6936a1.webp","image":"6742a167cf3e5b814b6936a1","servings":4,"cuisine":["American","Caribbean"],"course":["Appetizer","Main Course"],"occasions":["Weeknight Dinner","Family Gathering"],"mealUrl":"yam-soup-6742a167cf3e5b814b69369c","SEOLongkeywords":["easy yam soup recipe","creamy yam soup","healthy soup recipes","vegetarian yam soup","simple yam soup"],"dateCreated":"2024-11-24T03:45:46.001Z","createdAt":"2024-11-24T03:45:46.003Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-24T03:45:46.003Z","__v":0},"createdAt":"2024-11-24T03:46:02.634Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-24T03:46:02.634Z","__v":0}}
