This cake can also be made egg-free by using flaxseed meal or applesauce as a binding agent."},"faqs":[{"question":"What is the best way to measure flour accurately?","answer":"To measure flour accurately, use the spoon and level method.

Alternatively, you can microwave it for 5-10 seconds, but be careful not to melt it."},{"question":"Is it important to let the cake cool before slicing?","answer":"Yes!

If you need a gluten-free option, consider using a 1:1 gluten-free flour blend."},{"name":"ground ginger","advice":"For a fresher flavor, you can use freshly grated ginger instead, but you'll need to adjust the quantity since fresh ginger is less concentrated.

If you only have salted butter, reduce the added salt in the recipe by half. Make sure the butter is at room temperature for easier creaming."},{"name":"brown sugar","advice":"Light or dark brown sugar can be used interchangeably; dark brown sugar will yield a richer flavor. If you run out, you can substitute with white sugar mixed with a bit of molasses (1 cup white sugar + 1 tablespoon molasses for light brown sugar)."},{"name":"eggs","advice":"Eggs should be at room temperature for better emulsification. If you need an egg substitute, use 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce or 1/4 cup yogurt per egg."},{"name":"molasses","advice":"Choose unsulfured molasses for a cleaner flavor.
