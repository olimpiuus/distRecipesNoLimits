Always rinse lentils before cooking to remove any debris."},{"name":"fresh spinach","advice":"Use fresh spinach for the best flavor and texture, but you can substitute with frozen spinach if fresh is unavailable; just thaw and drain excess water before adding. For a different flavor, consider using kale or Swiss chard."},{"name":"coconut milk","advice":"Canned coconut milk gives a rich, creamy texture.
