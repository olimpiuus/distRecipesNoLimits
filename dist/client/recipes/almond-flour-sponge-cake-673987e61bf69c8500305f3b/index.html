If you need a substitute, you can use finely ground coconut flour, but reduce the amount to about 1/4 cup as it absorbs more moisture. Ensure that the almond flour is finely ground for the best texture.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">eggs</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Eggs provide structure and moisture. If you’re looking for a vegan substitute, you can use 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce or a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 2.5 tablespoons water, let sit for 5 minutes). Make sure to beat the eggs until frothy to incorporate air and lighten the mixture.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">honey or maple syrup</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Both honey and maple syrup add natural sweetness and moisture. If you&#x27;re looking for a sugar-free option, you could try using erythritol or stevia, adjusting to taste. Remember that honey is sweeter than maple syrup, so you may want to reduce the quantity slightly if substituting.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">baking powder</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Baking powder is a leavening agent that helps the cake rise. If you need a substitute, you can use 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda combined with 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar. Make sure your baking powder is fresh for optimal rising.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">vanilla extract</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Vanilla extract enhances the flavor profile of the cake. For a different flavor, you could substitute it with almond extract or add a splash of orange or lemon zest for a citrusy twist. If using vanilla essence, keep in mind it may not have the same depth of flavor.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">salt</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Salt enhances the overall flavor of the cake. If you&#x27;re on a sodium-restricted diet, you can reduce it or use a salt substitute. A pinch of sea salt can elevate flavors, so don’t skip it entirely.</p></div></div></section><section class="mb-12 text-justify"><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8 text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500 to-orange-600">Cooking Steps</h2><ul class="space-y-6"><li id="coocking-step-preheat-the-oven" class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-orange-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-800">Step <!-- -->1<!-- -->: <span class="text-orange-600">Preheat the Oven</span></h3><div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span>Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C).

If you need a substitute, you can use finely ground coconut flour, but reduce the amount to about 1/4 cup as it absorbs more moisture. Ensure that the almond flour is finely ground for the best texture."},{"name":"eggs","advice":"Eggs provide structure and moisture. If you’re looking for a vegan substitute, you can use 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce or a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 2.5 tablespoons water, let sit for 5 minutes). Make sure to beat the eggs until frothy to incorporate air and lighten the mixture."},{"name":"honey or maple syrup","advice":"Both honey and maple syrup add natural sweetness and moisture. If you're looking for a sugar-free option, you could try using erythritol or stevia, adjusting to taste. Remember that honey is sweeter than maple syrup, so you may want to reduce the quantity slightly if substituting."},{"name":"baking powder","advice":"Baking powder is a leavening agent that helps the cake rise. If you need a substitute, you can use 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda combined with 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar. Make sure your baking powder is fresh for optimal rising."},{"name":"vanilla extract","advice":"Vanilla extract enhances the flavor profile of the cake. For a different flavor, you could substitute it with almond extract or add a splash of orange or lemon zest for a citrusy twist. If using vanilla essence, keep in mind it may not have the same depth of flavor."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Salt enhances the overall flavor of the cake. If you're on a sodium-restricted diet, you can reduce it or use a salt substitute.
