For a non-alcoholic version, simply omit the rum or bourbon and add a splash of vanilla extract for flavor."},{"name":"dark rum or bourbon","advice":"Dark rum adds a rich, caramel flavor, while bourbon provides a smoother, sweeter profile. You can substitute with spiced rum for an additional layer of flavor.

If you want to avoid cinnamon altogether, try using a bit of ginger or a dash of pumpkin spice for an interesting flavor profile."},{"name":"whipped cream","advice":"Homemade whipped cream, made from heavy cream, will provide a richer flavor than store-bought.
