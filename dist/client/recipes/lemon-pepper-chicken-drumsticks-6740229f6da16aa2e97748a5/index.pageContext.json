Juicy drumsticks marinated in lemon juice and spices, baked to perfection! Perfect for weeknight dinners.","cookingSteps":[{"name":"Preheat the Oven","description":"Begin by preheating your oven to 425°F (220°C). This step is crucial as it ensures that the chicken cooks evenly and achieves a crispy skin. While the oven is heating, you can prepare the marinade."},{"name":"Prepare the Marinade","description":"In a large mixing bowl, combine 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt. Whisk together until well blended. The acidity from the lemon juice not only flavors the chicken but also helps to tenderize it."},{"name":"Marinate the Chicken","description":"Add 2 pounds of chicken drumsticks to the bowl with the marinade. Use your hands or tongs to toss the drumsticks until they are thoroughly coated in the marinade. For best results, let the chicken marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours in the refrigerator. This enhances the flavor."},{"name":"Prepare the Baking Sheet","description":"Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will prevent the chicken from sticking and make for an easier clean-up. If you don’t have parchment paper, lightly grease the baking sheet with a little olive oil."},{"name":"Arrange the Chicken Drumsticks","description":"Place the marinated chicken drumsticks on the prepared baking sheet, ensuring they are spaced apart to allow for even cooking. Avoid overcrowding the pan, as this can cause the chicken to steam rather than roast."},{"name":"Bake the Chicken","description":"Bake the drumsticks in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) and the skin is golden brown and crispy. For an extra crispy skin, you can turn on the broiler for the last 2-3 minutes of cooking, but watch closely to prevent burning."},{"name":"Serve and Enjoy","description":"Once cooked, remove the chicken drumsticks from the oven and let them rest for 5 minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute, making the chicken juicier. Serve hot, garnished with fresh lemon slices or a sprinkle of fresh herbs if desired."}],"pairings":{"pairings":"Pair the Lemon Pepper Chicken Drumsticks with a refreshing side salad made of mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, and a light vinaigrette. For a heartier option, serve with roasted vegetables like asparagus or Brussels sprouts. A chilled Sauvignon Blanc or a light, citrus-forward beer would complement the flavors beautifully, enhancing the zesty lemon and pepper notes.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the chicken drumsticks on a large platter, garnished with fresh lemon wedges and sprigs of parsley for a pop of color. For an added touch, drizzle a bit of extra olive oil on the chicken just before serving. Consider offering a side of garlic aioli or a yogurt-based dipping sauce for extra flavor.","dietary_considerations":"This dish is naturally gluten-free and can be made paleo by ensuring that the olive oil is high-quality and unrefined. For a low-carb option, serve with a side of steamed broccoli or cauliflower rice instead of starchy sides. If you're catering to those with dairy restrictions, this recipe fits well since it contains no dairy."},"faqs":[{"question":"What is the best way to prepare chicken drumsticks before cooking?","answer":"Rinse the drumsticks under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels. This helps remove any excess moisture, ensuring they roast nicely."},{"question":"How can I make sure the chicken is cooked through?","answer":"Use a meat thermometer! Chicken should reach an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C). This ensures it’s safe to eat and juicy."},{"question":"What if I don’t have fresh lemon juice?","answer":"You can use bottled lemon juice, but fresh juice provides a brighter flavor. If using bottled, you may want to reduce the quantity slightly as it can be more concentrated."},{"question":"How do I know when the chicken skin is golden brown?","answer":"Look for a deep golden color, and the skin should be crispy to the touch. If you're unsure, use a fork to poke the skin; it should feel firm."},{"question":"Can I marinate the chicken ahead of time?","answer":"Absolutely! Marinating the chicken for at least an hour or even overnight in the fridge can enhance the flavor."},{"question":"What can I serve with lemon pepper chicken?","answer":"Great sides include roasted vegetables, a fresh salad, or rice. They all complement the flavor of the chicken nicely."},{"question":"How do I safely handle raw chicken?","answer":"Always wash your hands before and after handling raw chicken, and use separate cutting boards for raw meat and vegetables to avoid cross-contamination."},{"question":"Is olive oil necessary for this recipe?","answer":"Olive oil adds flavor and helps the marinade stick to the chicken, but you can substitute it with another oil like vegetable oil if needed."},{"question":"What if I don’t have garlic powder?","answer":"You can use fresh minced garlic instead; about 1-2 cloves should work. Just be sure to adjust to your taste!"},{"question":"How can I make this dish spicier?","answer":"Add some cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes to the marinade for a kick. Start with a small amount and increase to your taste."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"chicken drumsticks","advice":"For optimal flavor and texture, choose drumsticks that are uniform in size to ensure even cooking. If you're looking for a healthier option, you can substitute chicken thighs or breasts, but adjust the cooking time as they may cook faster. Always pat them dry before marinating to help the skin crisp up."},{"name":"lemon juice","advice":"Freshly squeezed lemon juice is preferred for a brighter flavor, but bottled lemon juice can be used in a pinch. If you want to enhance the lemon flavor, consider adding some lemon zest to the marinade for an extra citrusy kick."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Extra virgin olive oil will provide a more robust flavor compared to regular olive oil. If you're looking for a different flavor profile, you can substitute with avocado oil or melted coconut oil. Just be mindful that different oils can have different smoke points."},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly cracked black pepper offers more flavor than pre-ground pepper. If you want to add more complexity, consider mixing in some crushed red pepper flakes for heat, or use a blend of cracked peppercorns, such as white and green pepper."},{"name":"garlic powder","advice":"Garlic powder is convenient, but for a more potent garlic flavor, use fresh minced garlic instead. You can also roast whole garlic cloves and mash them into a paste to add to the marinade for a sweeter, caramelized flavor."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Kosher salt is recommended for its texture and ease of use. If you're watching your sodium intake, you can reduce the amount of salt or use a low-sodium seasoning blend. Always taste your marinade before adding the chicken to ensure it’s seasoned to your liking."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"6740229f6da16aa2e97748a5","name":"Lemon Pepper Chicken Drumsticks","ingredients":[{"name":"chicken drumsticks","quantity":"2 pounds","_id":"674022a16da16aa2e97748b1"},{"name":"lemon juice","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"674022a16da16aa2e97748b2"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"674022a16da16aa2e97748b3"},{"name":"black pepper","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"674022a16da16aa2e97748b4"},{"name":"garlic powder","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"674022a16da16aa2e97748b5"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"674022a16da16aa2e97748b6"}],"calories":320,"allergens":[],"dietaryTags":["Gluten-Free","Dairy-Free"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":10,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":40,"tags":["Easy","Quick","Baked"],"quickTastyDescription":"Juicy chicken drumsticks marinated in zesty lemon and pepper, baked to perfection.","detailedCookingInstructions":["Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).","In a large bowl, mix together lemon juice, olive oil, black pepper, garlic powder, and salt.","Add the chicken drumsticks to the bowl and toss until they are well coated in the marinade.","Place the drumsticks on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.","Bake for 35-40 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the skin is golden brown.","Serve hot and enjoy your delicious lemon pepper chicken!"],"createdByModel":"4o","detailedName":"Baked Lemon Pepper Chicken Drumsticks","baseMeal":"Chicken","modifiersForBase":"Lemon and Pepper Marinade","imageUrl":"/images/lemon-pepper-chicken-drumsticks-6740229f6da16aa2e97748ab.webp","image":"6740229f6da16aa2e97748ab","servings":4,"cuisine":["American"],"course":["Main Course"],"dateCreated":"2024-11-22T06:20:17.804Z","createdAt":"2024-11-22T06:20:17.806Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-23T06:06:14.859Z","__v":0,"mealUrl":"lemon-pepper-chicken-drumsticks-6740229f6da16aa2e97748a5"},"__v":0}}
