Fresh cranberries can also be stored in the refrigerator for up to two months, so feel free to buy extra."},{"name":"sugar","advice":"Granulated sugar is the most common choice, but you can experiment with alternatives like brown sugar for a deeper flavor, or honey/maple syrup for a natural sweetener (reduce the amount slightly as these are sweeter).

If you want to enhance the flavor, consider substituting half of the water with additional orange juice or apple juice to add complexity."},{"name":"orange juice","advice":"Freshly squeezed orange juice will provide the best flavor, but bottled juice works too. For a twist, try adding the zest of an orange to the sauce for an extra citrus kick.
