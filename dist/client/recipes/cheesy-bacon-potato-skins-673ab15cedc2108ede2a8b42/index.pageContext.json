For a meatier touch, pair the skins with grilled chicken or BBQ ribs, as the smoky flavors will enhance the savory profile of the dish.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the Cheesy Bacon Potato Skins hot out of the oven on a rustic wooden platter for a casual gathering. Offer a variety of dipping sauces alongside, such as ranch dressing, spicy sriracha mayo, or a zesty guacamole, to add an extra layer of flavor.
