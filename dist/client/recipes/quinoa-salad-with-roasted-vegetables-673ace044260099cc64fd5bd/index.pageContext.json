This helps remove the bitter saponins that coat the seeds."},{"question":"What is the right water-to-quinoa ratio for cooking?","answer":"Typically, the ratio is 2 cups of water for every 1 cup of quinoa. However, always check the package instructions as some brands may vary."},{"question":"How do I know when the vegetables are done roasting?","answer":"The vegetables are done when they are tender and have a nice golden brown color. You can test by piercing them with a fork; they should be soft but not mushy."},{"question":"Is it necessary to peel the zucchini and red onion?","answer":"No, it's not necessary to peel zucchini. The skin is nutritious and adds texture. For the red onion, you can peel it to reduce the sharpness, but it's a matter of personal preference."},{"question":"How can I prevent my quinoa from being mushy?","answer":"Make sure to rinse your quinoa before cooking, and use the correct water-to-quinoa ratio. After cooking, fluff it gently with a fork to separate the grains."},{"question":"What can I substitute for feta cheese?","answer":"If you want to keep it dairy-free, you can leave out the feta cheese or use a plant-based cheese alternative. You could also use avocado for creaminess."},{"question":"How do I store leftover quinoa salad?","answer":"Store leftover quinoa salad in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

For added flavor, you can toast the quinoa in a dry pan for a few minutes before boiling it. If you don't have quinoa, consider using couscous, bulgur, or even rice as a substitute."},{"name":"bell peppers (mixed colors)","advice":"Choose bell peppers that are firm and vibrant in color for the best flavor. Roasting enhances their sweetness; you can also marinate them in balsamic vinegar for an extra flavor boost. If you're out of bell peppers, try using other vegetables such as cherry tomatoes or carrots."},{"name":"zucchini","advice":"Select young, firm zucchinis for a better texture. When slicing, consider cutting them into half-moons or cubes for even cooking. If zucchini is not available, yellow squash can be a good substitute."},{"name":"red onion","advice":"Red onions are milder and sweeter than yellow onions, making them perfect for salads. Soaking them in cold water for 10-15 minutes can reduce their sharpness if desired. If you don't have red onions, yellow or sweet onions can be used instead."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Use high-quality extra virgin olive oil for the best flavor. You can infuse it with garlic or herbs for an extra layer of taste. If you're looking for a substitute, avocado oil or melted coconut oil can work, though they will change the flavor profile slightly."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Use sea salt or kosher salt for better flavor control. Remember, you can always add more salt later, but you can't take it out once it's in. If you're watching your sodium intake, try using herbs and spices to enhance flavor instead."},{"name":"pepper","advice":"Freshly cracked black pepper adds a stronger flavor than pre-ground pepper. Experiment with different types of peppercorns for varied flavors, such as white or pink peppercorns. If you're out of black pepper, a pinch of cayenne or chili powder can provide some heat."},{"name":"lemon juice","advice":"Freshly squeezed lemon juice is preferable to bottled for a brighter flavor. You can also add lemon zest for an extra citrusy kick. If you don't have lemons, lime juice or vinegar can serve as good substitutes."},{"name":"feta cheese (optional)","advice":"Feta adds a tangy and creamy element to the salad. If you want a dairy-free option, try using crumbled tofu or nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavor. Other alternatives include goat cheese or even a sprinkle of parmesan."},{"name":"fresh parsley","advice":"Use flat-leaf parsley for a more robust flavor compared to curly parsley. Chop it finely to release its oils. If you don't have parsley, fresh basil or cilantro can offer a different but delightful flavor profile."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673ace044260099cc64fd5bd","name":"Quinoa Salad with Roasted Vegetables","ingredients":[{"name":"quinoa","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673ace064260099cc64fd5d1"},{"name":"bell peppers (mixed colors)","quantity":"2","_id":"673ace064260099cc64fd5d2"},{"name":"zucchini","quantity":"1","_id":"673ace064260099cc64fd5d3"},{"name":"red onion","quantity":"1","_id":"673ace064260099cc64fd5d4"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"3 tablespoons","_id":"673ace064260099cc64fd5d5"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673ace064260099cc64fd5d6"},{"name":"pepper","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673ace064260099cc64fd5d7"},{"name":"lemon juice","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"673ace064260099cc64fd5d8"},{"name":"feta cheese (optional)","quantity":"1/2 cup","_id":"673ace064260099cc64fd5d9"},{"name":"fresh parsley","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"673ace064260099cc64fd5da"}],"calories":350,"allergens":["Dairy (if using feta)"],"dietaryTags":["Vegetarian","Gluten-Free","Healthy"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":10,"preparationTime":15,"cookingTime":30,"tags":["Salad","Healthy","Quick","Vegetarian"],"quickTastyDescription":"A protein-packed salad with vibrant roasted vegetables and a zesty dressing, perfect for a healthy meal.","detailedCookingInstructions":["Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).","Rinse the quinoa under cold water and cook it according to package instructions (usually 2 cups of water for 1 cup of quinoa).","Chop the bell peppers, zucchini, and red onion into bite-sized pieces.","On a baking sheet, toss the chopped vegetables with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
