Perfect for summer grilling, this vibrant dish combines marinated chicken and fresh veggies, offering a flavorful and healthy meal option.","cookingSteps":[{"name":"Soak the Skewers","description":"Start by soaking the wooden skewers in water for 10-15 minutes. This step is crucial as it prevents the skewers from burning on the grill, allowing you to enjoy your skewers without any charred bits."},{"name":"Prepare the Chicken","description":"Cut the chicken breast into bite-sized cubes, roughly 1-2 inches each.

For a more casual setting, serve the skewers as part of a barbecue buffet with various dipping sauces and side salads.","dietary_considerations":"This dish can easily be made gluten-free by ensuring that the harissa paste is gluten-free. For a vegetarian option, substitute chicken with firm tofu or marinated portobello mushrooms and keep the same marinating process.
