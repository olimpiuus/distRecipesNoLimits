If you prefer, you can substitute with chicken thighs for a juicier result. To ensure even cooking, pound the chicken to an even thickness or cut it into smaller pieces.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">olive oil</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Extra virgin olive oil is best for flavor, but you can substitute with avocado oil or canola oil if you need a higher smoke point. For added flavor, consider infusing the oil with herbs or spices beforehand.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">fresh rosemary</h3><p class="text-gray-700">If fresh rosemary is unavailable, dried rosemary can be used, but use only about a third of the amount as it&#x27;s more potent. Alternatively, thyme or oregano can be substituted for a different flavor profile.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">fresh thyme</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Similar to rosemary, if fresh thyme is not available, use dried thyme at a reduced quantity. For a fresh twist, try substituting with fresh basil or parsley, although the flavor will be different.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">garlic</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Roasting the garlic before adding it to the marinade will give a sweeter and more mellow flavor. If you&#x27;re short on time, garlic powder can be used in a pinch, but fresh garlic is recommended for the best flavor.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">salt</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Use kosher salt for better texture and ease of use. If you&#x27;re watching sodium intake, consider using a low-sodium alternative or try sea salt for a different flavor.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">black pepper</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Freshly cracked black pepper will provide a more robust flavor compared to pre-ground. For a bit of heat, consider adding crushed red pepper flakes to the marinade.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">potatoes</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Yukon Gold or Russet potatoes work well for mashing due to their starch content. If you want a creamier texture, add some cream cheese or sour cream while mashing. For a healthier option, you can substitute half the potatoes with cauliflower.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">butter</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Use unsalted butter for better control over the salt levels in your dish. For a dairy-free version, consider using olive oil or a plant-based butter substitute.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">milk</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Whole milk will give the creamiest texture, but feel free to use low-fat milk, almond milk, or even chicken broth for a different flavor.
