Cook until tender, about 15-20 minutes."},{"name":"Mash the Potatoes","description":"Once the potatoes are fork-tender, drain them and return to the pot.

Optionally, garnish with extra fresh herbs for an appealing presentation."}],"pairings":{"pairings":"For a delightful pairing, consider serving the grilled herb-marinated chicken breast with a light, crisp white wine such as Sauvignon Blanc or a refreshing rosé. If you prefer a non-alcoholic option, a sparkling water with a twist of lemon or a fresh herbal iced tea would complement the dish beautifully. For a heartier meal, add a side of grilled asparagus or a mixed green salad drizzled with a lemon vinaigrette to enhance the fresh herb flavors.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the grilled chicken breast sliced on a platter, garnished with fresh herbs like rosemary and thyme for a pop of color. Accompany it with a bowl of roasted garlic mashed potatoes, topped with a pat of butter or a sprinkle of chives for added flavor.

This presentation is perfect for a casual family dinner or a summer barbecue gathering.","dietary_considerations":"This dish can be adapted for various dietary preferences. For a gluten-free option, ensure that all ingredients used (especially any additional sauces or dressings) are certified gluten-free.

Additionally, this dish is low-carb friendly as it primarily focuses on lean protein and can be paired with non-starchy vegetables for a balanced meal."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I prepare chicken breasts for marinating?","answer":"Start by trimming any excess fat from the chicken breasts. Then, you can use a meat mallet or rolling pin to gently pound them to an even thickness. This ensures they'll cook evenly. Also, make small cuts in the surface of the chicken to help the marinade penetrate better."},{"question":"What is the best way to chop fresh herbs?","answer":"To chop fresh herbs like rosemary and thyme, first remove the leaves from the stems. Gather the leaves into a bunch and use a sharp knife to slice them finely. A rocking motion with the knife helps achieve a fine chop."},{"question":"How do I know when the chicken is fully cooked?","answer":"Chicken is fully cooked when it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C). You can use a meat thermometer to check the temperature, or cut into the thickest part of the breast; the juices should run clear, not pink."},{"question":"What type of potatoes are best for mashed potatoes?","answer":"For creamy mashed potatoes, Yukon Gold or Russet potatoes are great choices. They have a starchy texture that mashes well."},{"question":"How do I roast garlic?","answer":"To roast garlic, preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Cut the top off a whole head of garlic to expose the cloves, drizzle with olive oil, wrap it in foil, and bake for about 30-35 minutes until the cloves are soft and golden. You can squeeze the roasted garlic out of the skins easily."},{"question":"What if I don't have a grill?","answer":"If you don’t have a grill, you can cook the marinated chicken in a skillet on the stove or bake it in the oven at 400°F (200°C) for about 20-25 minutes, turning halfway through."},{"question":"How can I make mashed potatoes creamy?","answer":"To achieve creamy mashed potatoes, make sure to drain them well after boiling. Adding warm milk and softened butter helps create a smooth texture. Avoid over-mashing, as this can make them gummy."},{"question":"What are some tips for kitchen safety?","answer":"Always wash your hands before handling food, keep raw meat separate from other ingredients to avoid cross-contamination, and use separate cutting boards for meats and vegetables. Also, be careful with knives and hot surfaces!"},{"question":"How can I add more flavor to my grilled chicken?","answer":"Marinating the chicken for a longer period (up to 24 hours) enhances its flavor. You can also experiment by adding different spices, citrus juices, or even yogurt to your marinade."},{"question":"What should I serve with grilled chicken and mashed potatoes?","answer":"You can serve a simple salad or steamed vegetables like green beans or broccoli for a well-rounded meal. A light vinaigrette complements the flavors nicely."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"chicken breasts","advice":"Choose boneless, skinless chicken breasts for quicker cooking and easier marinating. If you prefer, you can substitute with chicken thighs for a juicier result. To ensure even cooking, pound the chicken to an even thickness or cut it into smaller pieces."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Extra virgin olive oil is best for flavor, but you can substitute with avocado oil or canola oil if you need a higher smoke point. For added flavor, consider infusing the oil with herbs or spices beforehand."},{"name":"fresh rosemary","advice":"If fresh rosemary is unavailable, dried rosemary can be used, but use only about a third of the amount as it's more potent. Alternatively, thyme or oregano can be substituted for a different flavor profile."},{"name":"fresh thyme","advice":"Similar to rosemary, if fresh thyme is not available, use dried thyme at a reduced quantity. For a fresh twist, try substituting with fresh basil or parsley, although the flavor will be different."},{"name":"garlic","advice":"Roasting the garlic before adding it to the marinade will give a sweeter and more mellow flavor. If you're short on time, garlic powder can be used in a pinch, but fresh garlic is recommended for the best flavor."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Use kosher salt for better texture and ease of use. If you're watching sodium intake, consider using a low-sodium alternative or try sea salt for a different flavor."},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly cracked black pepper will provide a more robust flavor compared to pre-ground. For a bit of heat, consider adding crushed red pepper flakes to the marinade."},{"name":"potatoes","advice":"Yukon Gold or Russet potatoes work well for mashing due to their starch content. If you want a creamier texture, add some cream cheese or sour cream while mashing. For a healthier option, you can substitute half the potatoes with cauliflower."},{"name":"butter","advice":"Use unsalted butter for better control over the salt levels in your dish. For a dairy-free version, consider using olive oil or a plant-based butter substitute."},{"name":"milk","advice":"Whole milk will give the creamiest texture, but feel free to use low-fat milk, almond milk, or even chicken broth for a different flavor. For extra richness, you can also add cream or buttermilk."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673acacdf103cfe5fb9806e1","name":"Grilled Herb-Marinated Chicken Breast with Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes","ingredients":[{"name":"chicken breasts","quantity":"2 large","_id":"673acad0f103cfe5fb9806f1"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"673acad0f103cfe5fb9806f2"},{"name":"fresh rosemary","quantity":"1 tablespoon","_id":"673acad0f103cfe5fb9806f3"},{"name":"fresh thyme","quantity":"1 tablespoon","_id":"673acad0f103cfe5fb9806f4"},{"name":"garlic","quantity":"3 cloves","_id":"673acad0f103cfe5fb9806f5"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"673acad0f103cfe5fb9806f6"},{"name":"black pepper","quantity":"1/2 teaspoon","_id":"673acad0f103cfe5fb9806f7"},{"name":"potatoes","quantity":"2 large","_id":"673acad0f103cfe5fb9806f8"},{"name":"butter","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"673acad0f103cfe5fb9806f9"},{"name":"milk","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"673acad0f103cfe5fb9806fa"}],"calories":600,"allergens":["Dairy"],"dietaryTags":["Gluten-Free","High-Protein"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":15,"preparationTime":15,"cookingTime":30,"tags":["Grilled","Comfort Food","Easy Weeknight Meal"],"quickTastyDescription":"Juicy grilled chicken marinated with fresh herbs, served with creamy roasted garlic mashed potatoes for a comforting meal.","detailedCookingInstructions":["In a small bowl, mix olive oil, chopped rosemary, thyme, minced garlic, salt, and pepper to create the marinade.","Place chicken breasts in a ziplock bag or bowl, pour marinade over, and let it sit for at least 15 minutes (or longer in the fridge for more flavor).","Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.
