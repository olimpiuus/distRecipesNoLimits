If you're looking for a healthier option, skinless chicken breast can be used instead. For added flavor, consider marinating the chicken with herbs and spices before cooking."},{"name":"mixed salad greens","advice":"Choose a variety of greens like arugula, spinach, and romaine for a mix of textures and flavors.
