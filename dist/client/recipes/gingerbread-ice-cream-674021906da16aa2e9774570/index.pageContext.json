Pour the cream in until it reaches the desired measurement. Make sure to check at eye level for the correct amount."},{"question":"How do I properly incorporate ingredients to avoid lumps?","answer":"When adding dry ingredients like spices to wet ingredients, sprinkle them evenly over the surface first, then whisk vigorously to combine thoroughly.

If you're looking for a lighter option, you can substitute half of the heavy cream with whole milk, but this may result in a less creamy texture."},{"name":"sweetened condensed milk","advice":"Sweetened condensed milk adds sweetness and creaminess, making it a key ingredient. If you need a dairy-free alternative, use coconut condensed milk, which also imparts a lovely flavor. You can also make your own by simmering milk and sugar until thickened."},{"name":"ground ginger","advice":"Ground ginger provides warmth and spice. For a fresher taste, consider using freshly grated ginger, but use about half the amount as it is more potent. If you don’t have ground ginger, you can use ground cardamom for a different but compatible flavor."},{"name":"ground cinnamon","advice":"Ground cinnamon is essential for the gingerbread flavor. If you want to enhance the flavor, consider using Ceylon cinnamon, which is sweeter and more aromatic than the more common Cassia cinnamon. You can also add a pinch of allspice for a more complex flavor."},{"name":"ground nutmeg","advice":"Ground nutmeg adds a warm, nutty flavor. Freshly grated nutmeg is much more aromatic and flavorful, so if you have whole nutmeg on hand, use a microplane to grate it just before mixing. If you don't have nutmeg, you can increase the cinnamon slightly as a substitute."},{"name":"molasses","advice":"Molasses is crucial for achieving that deep, rich flavor characteristic of gingerbread. If you don't have molasses, you can substitute with dark corn syrup or honey, but the flavor will be different. Mixing a small amount of brown sugar with a bit of water can also mimic the consistency."},{"name":"vanilla extract","advice":"Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the ice cream.
