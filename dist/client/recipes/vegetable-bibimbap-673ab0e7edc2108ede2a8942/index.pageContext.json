For gluten-free options, substitute regular soy sauce with tamari. You can also add tofu or tempeh for additional protein, making it suitable for a variety of dietary preferences."},"faqs":[{"question":"What is blanched spinach and how do I prepare it?","answer":"Blanched spinach is spinach briefly cooked in boiling water and then quickly cooled in ice water. To prepare it, bring a pot of water to a boil, add the spinach for about 1-2 minutes until wilted, then transfer it to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain and squeeze out excess water before using."},{"question":"How do I julienne carrots and zucchini?","answer":"To julienne, first cut the vegetable into 2-3 inch sections. Then, slice each section into thin strips (about 1/8 inch thick). Stack a few strips and cut them into matchstick shapes. This technique helps them cook evenly."},{"question":"What is gochujang and can I substitute it?","answer":"Gochujang is a Korean chili paste that adds a sweet and spicy flavor. If you can't find it, you can substitute with a mix of red pepper flakes and a small amount of sugar or honey, but the flavor will be different."},{"question":"How do I fry an egg sunny-side up without it sticking?","answer":"To fry an egg sunny-side up, use a non-stick skillet and heat it over medium-low heat. Add a little oil or butter and let it melt. Crack the egg gently into the pan, cook it slowly until the white is set but the yolk is still runny, about 2-3 minutes. Avoid moving the egg too much to prevent sticking."},{"question":"What can I do to prevent my vegetables from getting soggy?","answer":"To keep your vegetables crisp, avoid overcrowding the pan and cook them in batches if necessary. Sauté them just until tender, and remove them from the heat quickly. This will help maintain their texture."},{"question":"How can I adjust the spiciness of my bibimbap?","answer":"You can adjust the spiciness by varying the amount of gochujang you use. Start with less than the recipe calls for, then taste it and add more if you like it spicier. You can also serve extra gochujang on the side."},{"question":"What type of rice should I use for bibimbap?","answer":"Short-grain rice is usually used for bibimbap because it’s stickier and holds together well. However, you can use medium or long-grain rice if that's what you have, just be sure to wash it thoroughly before cooking to remove excess starch."},{"question":"Do I need to use all the vegetables listed?","answer":"No, you can customize bibimbap with any vegetables you have on hand. Common substitutes include bell peppers, bean sprouts, or radishes. Just aim for a variety of colors and textures for a visually appealing dish."},{"question":"What is the best way to serve bibimbap?","answer":"Bibimbap is best served in individual bowls. Start with a base of rice, then arrange the sautéed vegetables and fried egg on top. Drizzle with gochujang and sprinkle with sesame seeds and green onions before mixing everything together and enjoying!"},{"question":"How can I store leftovers?","answer":"Store leftover bibimbap components separately in airtight containers in the refrigerator. The vegetables and rice can be reheated in the microwave, and the egg should be cooked fresh if possible."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"cooked rice","advice":"Use short-grain rice for a stickier texture, which is traditional for bibimbap. If you don't have rice, quinoa or cauliflower rice can be good substitutes. Make sure to rinse the rice before cooking to remove excess starch for better texture."},{"name":"carrot","advice":"Julienne the carrot for even cooking. You can substitute with other vegetables like bell peppers or radishes if needed. To enhance flavor, consider lightly pickling the julienned carrots in rice vinegar and sugar for a sweet tang."},{"name":"zucchini","advice":"Julienne or slice thinly for quick cooking. If you don’t have zucchini, yellow squash or cucumber can work as substitutes. Sauté just until tender to keep the crunch, and consider adding a pinch of salt to enhance its natural flavors."},{"name":"spinach","advice":"Blanching spinach helps retain its vibrant color and nutrients. If fresh spinach isn't available, you can use frozen spinach – just thaw and drain it well.

If you are out of mushrooms, you can substitute with eggplant or tofu. Sautéing them until they are golden will enhance their flavor."},{"name":"egg","advice":"Frying the eggs sunny-side up gives a nice runny yolk to mix into the rice. If you prefer, you can use poached eggs or scrambled eggs as alternatives. For a twist, try adding a sprinkle of cheese on top while cooking."},{"name":"gochujang (korean chili paste)","advice":"Gochujang is essential for authentic flavor.

If you need a substitute, you can use olive oil, but keep in mind it will alter the final taste."},{"name":"soy sauce","advice":"Opt for low-sodium soy sauce if you are watching your salt intake. Tamari or liquid aminos can be used as gluten-free alternatives. Consider adding a splash of rice vinegar for a hint of acidity."},{"name":"sesame seeds","advice":"Toasting sesame seeds enhances their flavor.
