Perfect for a nutritious meal!","cookingSteps":[{"name":"Rinse the Quinoa","description":"Begin by rinsing 1 cup of quinoa under cold water. This step is crucial as it removes the natural coating called saponin, which can make the quinoa taste bitter. Use a fine mesh strainer to ensure none of the quinoa grains escape."},{"name":"Cook the Quinoa","description":"In a medium pot, combine the rinsed quinoa with 2 cups of water. Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the water is fully absorbed. This is a perfect time to prep your veggies!"},{"name":"Fluff and Cool the Quinoa","description":"After 15 minutes, remove the pot from the heat. Let it sit, covered, for an additional 5 minutes to allow it to steam. Then, fluff the quinoa with a fork to separate the grains. Spread it out on a plate or in a bowl to cool; this prevents the vegetables from wilting when mixed."},{"name":"Prepare the Vegetables","description":"While the quinoa is cooling, chop your vegetables. Dice 1 cucumber, halve 1 cup of cherry tomatoes, and dice 1 red bell pepper. Finely chop 1/4 of a red onion. If you enjoy different textures and flavors, consider adding other vegetables like diced avocado or shredded carrots."},{"name":"Combine Ingredients in a Large Bowl","description":"In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooled quinoa with the chopped cucumber, cherry tomatoes, red bell pepper, red onion, and crumbled 1/2 cup of feta cheese.

This step is optional but highly recommended for a burst of flavor and nutrients. Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to an hour to let the flavors meld."}],"pairings":{"pairings":"For a delightful pairing, serve the Mediterranean Quinoa Bowl with grilled chicken or shrimp to add a protein boost.
