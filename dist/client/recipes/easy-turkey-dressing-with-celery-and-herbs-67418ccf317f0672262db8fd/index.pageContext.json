Consider offering it alongside a seasonal salad with mixed greens, walnuts, and a light vinaigrette to balance the richness of the dish. For a comforting family-style presentation, serve in large bowls so guests can help themselves, allowing the aroma to fill the dining area.","dietary_considerations":"This dressing can easily be made gluten-free by using gluten-free bread cubes.

The dish is inherently nut-free, making it suitable for those with nut allergies."},"faqs":[{"question":"What type of bread should I use for stuffing?","answer":"You can use any bread that's sturdy enough to hold up in the mixture, such as white, whole wheat, or sourdough.

You can always add more seasoning if you feel it needs it!"},{"question":"Do I have to cover the baking dish with foil?","answer":"Covering the dish with foil helps to steam the dressing and prevents it from drying out during the first part of baking.

You can substitute with olive oil or vegan butter for a dairy-free version."},{"name":"chicken broth","advice":"Homemade broth will add more depth to the dish; however, store-bought broth works fine.
