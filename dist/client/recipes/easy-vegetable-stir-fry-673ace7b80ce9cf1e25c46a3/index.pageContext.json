Sauté for about 30 seconds, stirring continuously, until fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic, as it can turn bitter."},{"name":"Add Mixed Vegetables","description":"Add 4 cups of mixed vegetables (bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, snap peas) to the skillet.

Serve hot, either alone or over a bed of rice or noodles for a complete meal."}],"pairings":{"pairings":"For a complete meal, pair the Easy Vegetable Stir-Fry with jasmine or brown rice to absorb the flavors. For protein options, consider adding grilled chicken, shrimp, or tofu for a vegetarian option.

Consider using chopsticks for an authentic Asian dining experience.","dietary_considerations":"This stir-fry is naturally vegetarian and can easily be made vegan by ensuring that the soy sauce is gluten-free and using a plant-based protein option like tofu.

Common choices include bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, snap peas, and zucchini. Choose a mix of colors and textures for a more vibrant dish."},{"question":"How do I prepare vegetables for stir-frying?","answer":"Wash your vegetables thoroughly, and then cut them into uniform bite-sized pieces. This ensures even cooking. For example, slice bell peppers into strips, chop broccoli into florets, and slice carrots into thin rounds."},{"question":"How do I know when my stir-fry is done?","answer":"Vegetables should be crisp-tender, meaning they are cooked but still have a bit of crunch. This typically takes about 5-7 minutes over medium-high heat."},{"question":"Can I use other oils instead of olive oil?","answer":"Yes! While olive oil is great, you can also use oils with higher smoke points like vegetable oil, canola oil, or peanut oil for stir-frying."},{"question":"What if I don't have fresh garlic or ginger?","answer":"You can use garlic and ginger powder as substitutes! Use about 1/4 teaspoon of each for every clove or teaspoon of fresh. However, fresh ingredients provide a more vibrant flavor."},{"question":"How can I make my stir-fry more flavorful?","answer":"In addition to soy sauce, consider adding a splash of sesame oil, a pinch of red pepper flakes, or a squeeze of lime juice for extra flavor. Experiment with different seasonings!"},{"question":"What should I do if my vegetables start to burn?","answer":"If you notice burning, reduce the heat slightly and add a splash of water or broth to the pan to deglaze it and prevent sticking."},{"question":"Is it necessary to use sesame seeds?","answer":"No, sesame seeds are optional, but they add a nice crunch and nutty flavor.

You can wash and chop your vegetables a day in advance. Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator to keep them fresh."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"mixed vegetables (bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, snap peas)","advice":"Feel free to use any combination of fresh or frozen vegetables. If using frozen, add them directly to the pan without thawing to maintain their crunch. You can substitute with other vegetables like zucchini, asparagus, or mushrooms based on your preference."},{"name":"soy sauce","advice":"For a gluten-free option, use tamari instead of soy sauce. If you prefer a low-sodium version, opt for low-sodium soy sauce to reduce salt intake. You can also experiment with coconut aminos for a slightly sweeter flavor."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"While olive oil is great for this dish, you can substitute with vegetable oil or sesame oil for a more authentic Asian flavor. If using sesame oil, consider using it in combination with a neutral oil since it has a strong flavor."},{"name":"garlic (minced)","advice":"Fresh garlic provides the best flavor, but you can use garlic powder as a substitute if necessary (1/8 teaspoon per clove). To enhance the flavor, consider roasting the garlic before adding it to the stir-fry."},{"name":"ginger (minced)","advice":"Fresh ginger adds a zingy flavor, but ground ginger can be used in a pinch (1/4 teaspoon per teaspoon of fresh). For a more intense flavor, grate the ginger instead of mincing it."},{"name":"sesame seeds (optional)","advice":"Toasting sesame seeds before adding them will enhance their nutty flavor. If you don't have sesame seeds, crushed peanuts or cashews can be a great substitute for added crunch."},{"name":"green onions (sliced)","advice":"Both the green and white parts of green onions are edible and flavorful. If you don't have green onions, you can substitute with chives or shallots for a different but complementary flavor."},{"name":"salt and pepper to taste","advice":"Always taste your dish before adding salt, especially since soy sauce is already salty. For added depth, consider using freshly cracked black pepper or a sprinkle of chili flakes for heat."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673ace7b80ce9cf1e25c46a3","name":"Easy Vegetable Stir-Fry","ingredients":[{"name":"mixed vegetables (bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, snap peas)","quantity":"4 cups","_id":"673ace7d80ce9cf1e25c46ac"},{"name":"soy sauce","quantity":"3 tablespoons","_id":"673ace7d80ce9cf1e25c46ad"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"673ace7d80ce9cf1e25c46ae"},{"name":"garlic (minced)","quantity":"2 cloves","_id":"673ace7d80ce9cf1e25c46af"},{"name":"ginger (minced)","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"673ace7d80ce9cf1e25c46b0"},{"name":"sesame seeds (optional)","quantity":"1 tablespoon","_id":"673ace7d80ce9cf1e25c46b1"},{"name":"green onions (sliced)","quantity":"2","_id":"673ace7d80ce9cf1e25c46b2"},{"name":"salt and pepper to taste","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673ace7d80ce9cf1e25c46b3"}],"calories":150,"allergens":["Soy"],"dietaryTags":["Vegetarian","Vegan","Gluten-Free"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":10,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":15,"tags":["Quick","Healthy","Colorful"],"quickTastyDescription":"A colorful mix of fresh vegetables sautéed to perfection, combined with a light soy sauce for a quick, healthy meal.","detailedCookingInstructions":["Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.","Add minced garlic and ginger, sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant.","Add mixed vegetables and stir-fry for about 5-7 minutes until crisp-tender.","Pour in soy sauce, and stir to coat the vegetables evenly.","Season with salt, pepper, and sprinkle with sesame seeds if desired.","Remove from heat and garnish with sliced green onions before serving."],"createdByModel":"4o","detailedName":"Quick and Colorful Vegetable Stir-Fry","baseMeal":"Stir-Fry","modifiersForBase":"Easy and quick to prepare with fresh vegetables","imageUrl":"/images/easy-vegetable-stir-fry-673ace7b80ce9cf1e25c46a7.webp","image":"673ace7b80ce9cf1e25c46a7","servings":4,"cuisine":["Asian","American"],"course":["Main","Side"],"dateCreated":"2024-11-18T05:19:57.593Z","createdAt":"2024-11-18T05:19:57.595Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-19T05:35:49.340Z","__v":0,"mealUrl":"easy-vegetable-stir-fry-673ace7b80ce9cf1e25c46a3"},"__v":0}}
