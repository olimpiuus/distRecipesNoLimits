Whisk together until well blended."},{"name":"Marinate the Chicken","description":"Place the 4 pieces of chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring all pieces are well coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours for a more intense flavor."},{"name":"Preheat the Grill or Oven","description":"While the chicken is marinating, preheat your grill or oven to 400°F (200°C). If using a grill, ensure the grates are clean and lightly oiled to prevent sticking."},{"name":"Cook the Chicken","description":"Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard any leftover marinade. If grilling, place the chicken on the grill and cook for about 6-7 minutes on each side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C). If baking, place the marinated chicken on a lined baking sheet and bake for 25-30 minutes."},{"name":"Rest and Serve","description":"Once cooked, transfer the chicken to a plate and let it rest for 5 minutes.

Slice the chicken and serve immediately, perhaps garnished with extra parsley and lemon slices."}],"pairings":{"pairings":"For a delightful meal, pair the Zesty Lemon Herb Chicken with a side of grilled vegetables such as zucchini, bell peppers, and asparagus, which complement the citrusy flavors of the chicken. Additionally, a light quinoa salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, and a lemon vinaigrette would enhance the dish. For beverages, consider serving a crisp Sauvignon Blanc or a refreshing iced herbal tea to balance the zesty notes.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the Zesty Lemon Herb Chicken on a platter garnished with fresh lemon slices and additional chopped parsley for a vibrant presentation. Accompany with a dipping sauce of tzatziki or a yogurt sauce infused with herbs to add a creamy contrast.

For a low-carb option, serve the chicken with a side of non-starchy vegetables. If preparing for a Whole30 or Paleo diet, ensure the marinade ingredients are compliant. To cater to those following a vegetarian or vegan diet, consider marinating and grilling portobello mushrooms or tofu in the same zesty marinade."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I properly prepare chicken breasts before cooking?","answer":"Start by rinsing the chicken breasts under cold water and patting them dry with paper towels. Trim off any excess fat or tendons with a sharp knife. If the breasts are uneven in thickness, you can pound them gently to ensure even cooking."},{"question":"What is the best way to marinate chicken?","answer":"Marinating chicken is simple! Combine your marinade ingredients in a bowl, then place the chicken in a resealable bag or shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the chicken, seal or cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. The longer you marinate, the more flavor the chicken will absorb."},{"question":"How can I tell when chicken is fully cooked?","answer":"The best way to check if chicken is done is to use a meat thermometer. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (75°C). If you don’t have a thermometer, you can cut into the thickest part of the chicken; it should be white and no longer pink."},{"question":"What’s the safest way to handle raw chicken?","answer":"Always wash your hands before and after handling raw chicken. Use separate cutting boards and utensils for raw chicken to avoid cross-contamination with other foods. Clean all surfaces with hot, soapy water after preparing chicken."},{"question":"How do I prevent chicken from drying out while cooking?","answer":"To keep chicken moist, avoid overcooking it. Use a meat thermometer to check for doneness, and consider marinating the chicken beforehand. Letting the chicken rest for a few minutes after cooking also helps retain its juices."},{"question":"What can I serve with zesty lemon herb chicken?","answer":"This chicken pairs well with a variety of sides! Consider serving it with steamed vegetables, a fresh salad, or rice pilaf. For a light touch, you can serve it with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice."},{"question":"Can I use frozen chicken for this recipe?","answer":"Yes, you can use frozen chicken, but make sure to fully thaw it in the refrigerator before marinating. Cooking time may increase slightly if the chicken is still cold from the fridge."},{"question":"What if I don’t have some of the herbs or spices listed?","answer":"No problem! Feel free to substitute or omit herbs based on what you have. For example, thyme or basil can replace oregano, and you can use garlic powder instead of fresh garlic if needed."},{"question":"How do I store leftover cooked chicken?","answer":"Allow the chicken to cool to room temperature, then store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. You can also freeze it for longer storage; just make sure to label the container with the date."},{"question":"What if I don’t have a grill?","answer":"You can easily bake the chicken in the oven at 400°F (200°C) as mentioned in the recipe. Simply place the marinated chicken on a baking sheet and bake for 25-30 minutes or until cooked through."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"chicken breasts","advice":"Choose boneless, skinless chicken breasts for quick cooking and ease of marinating. If you want more flavor and moisture, consider using bone-in chicken breasts. For a healthier option, you can substitute with turkey breasts or tofu for a vegetarian version."},{"name":"lemon juice","advice":"Freshly squeezed lemon juice will give the best flavor compared to bottled. If you're out of lemons, you can substitute with lime juice or white vinegar, but adjust the quantity to taste as they are more acidic."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Use extra virgin olive oil for a richer flavor; however, you can also use avocado oil or canola oil if you prefer a more neutral taste or want a higher smoke point for grilling."},{"name":"garlic (minced)","advice":"Fresh minced garlic provides the best flavor, but you can substitute with garlic powder (1/8 teaspoon per clove) if needed. For a milder taste, you can roast the garlic before mincing."},{"name":"fresh parsley (chopped)","advice":"Flat-leaf parsley is preferred for its robust flavor, but you can substitute with fresh cilantro or basil for a different twist. If fresh herbs aren't available, use 1 tablespoon of dried parsley."},{"name":"dried oregano","advice":"Greek oregano is ideal for this recipe, but you can also use Italian seasoning as a substitute. For a fresher taste, try using fresh oregano—just use about 2-3 times the amount as dried."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Kosher salt is great for cooking because of its texture and flavor. If using table salt, reduce the amount slightly as it is more concentrated. For a low-sodium option, you can use sea salt."},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly cracked black pepper adds more flavor compared to pre-ground. If you want more heat, consider adding a pinch of cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673acce894ab1a8249ab71a7","name":"Zesty Lemon Herb Chicken","ingredients":[{"name":"chicken breasts","quantity":"4 pieces","_id":"673acceb94ab1a8249ab71ba"},{"name":"lemon juice","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"673acceb94ab1a8249ab71bb"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"673acceb94ab1a8249ab71bc"},{"name":"garlic (minced)","quantity":"2 cloves","_id":"673acceb94ab1a8249ab71bd"},{"name":"fresh parsley (chopped)","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"673acceb94ab1a8249ab71be"},{"name":"dried oregano","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"673acceb94ab1a8249ab71bf"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"673acceb94ab1a8249ab71c0"},{"name":"black pepper","quantity":"1/2 teaspoon","_id":"673acceb94ab1a8249ab71c1"}],"calories":300,"allergens":[],"dietaryTags":["Gluten-Free","High-Protein"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":12.5,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":30,"tags":["Quick","Healthy","Grilled","Main Course"],"quickTastyDescription":"Juicy chicken marinated in zesty lemon and fresh herbs, perfect for a quick and flavorful meal.","detailedCookingInstructions":["In a bowl, mix lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, chopped parsley, oregano, salt, and pepper to create the marinade.","Place the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish and pour the marinade over the chicken.
