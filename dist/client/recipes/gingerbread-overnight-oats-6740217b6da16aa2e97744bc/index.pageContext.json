For a gluten-free option, ensure you use certified gluten-free oats."},{"name":"milk (dairy or non-dairy)","advice":"You can use any type of milk, such as whole, skim, almond, soy, or oat milk.

For a dairy-free version, use coconut yogurt or almond yogurt. Greek yogurt can be used for a thicker texture, or mix regular yogurt with a little extra milk to achieve desired consistency."},{"name":"maple syrup","advice":"Maple syrup adds a rich sweetness; if you don't have it, honey or agave syrup can be good substitutes.
