This helps remove any residue and ensures the skin crisps up nicely."},{"question":"What is the best way to mince garlic?","answer":"To mince garlic, first peel the cloves by gently smashing them with the flat side of a knife.

Use separate cutting boards for raw meat and vegetables, and ensure all utensils are cleaned thoroughly."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"chicken drumsticks","advice":"Choose drumsticks with skin on for extra flavor and crispy texture when baked. If you prefer skinless, be aware that the meat may be less juicy. You can also substitute with chicken thighs if you want a richer flavor."},{"name":"honey","advice":"Use a high-quality, raw honey if possible, as it has a more complex flavor. For a vegan option, substitute with maple syrup or agave nectar. If you're looking to reduce sweetness, you can cut the honey amount in half and add a bit of balsamic vinegar for acidity."},{"name":"soy sauce","advice":"Opt for low-sodium soy sauce to control salt levels in the dish.
