A crisp green salad with a light vinaigrette can complement the richness of the risotto. For beverages, a chilled white wine such as a Sauvignon Blanc or a light-bodied Pinot Grigio pairs beautifully, enhancing the earthy flavors of the mushrooms. For a non-alcoholic option, a sparkling water with a slice of lemon or a herbal tea like chamomile can be refreshing.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the risotto hot in shallow bowls to showcase its creamy texture.

You can also add seasonal vegetables like peas or asparagus for additional nutrients and colors."},"faqs":[{"question":"What is Arborio rice and why do I need it for risotto?","answer":"Arborio rice is a short-grain rice that is high in starch, which helps create the creamy texture characteristic of risotto. It absorbs liquid well while maintaining a firm bite, making it perfect for this dish."},{"question":"How can I ensure my mushrooms are clean before cooking?","answer":"To clean mushrooms, use a damp cloth or a soft brush to wipe off any dirt. Avoid soaking them in water, as they can absorb moisture and become soggy."},{"question":"Can I use regular cream instead of lactose-free cream?","answer":"Yes, you can use regular cream if you don't need a lactose-free option. However, for a lactose-free dish, stick with lactose-free cream to maintain its intended dietary purpose."},{"question":"What is the best way to chop an onion?","answer":"To chop an onion, first cut off the top (stem end) and root end. Peel off the outer skin, then slice the onion in half from top to bottom. Place the flat side down and make horizontal cuts, followed by vertical cuts, then slice across to create small pieces."},{"question":"How do I know when the risotto is cooked?","answer":"Risotto should be creamy and the rice should be al dente, meaning it should be cooked through but still have a slight bite. Taste a grain of rice towards the end of cooking to check for doneness."},{"question":"Why do I need to add broth gradually?","answer":"Adding broth gradually allows the rice to absorb the liquid slowly, which helps release the starches that create the creamy texture of risotto. Stir constantly to help with this process."},{"question":"What can I garnish my risotto with besides parsley?","answer":"You can also garnish your risotto with grated dairy-free cheese, a drizzle of olive oil, or even toasted pine nuts for added texture and flavor."},{"question":"How should I store leftover risotto?","answer":"Store leftover risotto in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, add a splash of broth or water to loosen it up, as it may become thick when chilled."},{"question":"Is it safe to eat raw garlic?","answer":"Yes, raw garlic is safe to eat and adds a pungent flavor to dishes. However, cooking it can mellow the flavor and reduce its sharpness."},{"question":"What kitchen tools do I need to make risotto?","answer":"You'll need a large skillet or saucepan, a ladle for adding broth, a wooden spoon for stirring, and a cutting board with a knife for chopping ingredients."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"arborio rice","advice":"Arborio rice is a short-grain rice that releases starch when cooked, giving risotto its creamy texture. If you don't have Arborio rice, you can substitute it with Carnaroli or Vialone Nano, which are also high-starch. In a pinch, you can use sushi rice or even a medium-grain white rice, but the texture may vary slightly. Make sure to rinse the rice before cooking to remove excess starch if you choose a non-Arborio option."},{"name":"vegetable broth","advice":"Vegetable broth is essential for flavor in risotto. You can make your own by simmering vegetable scraps, herbs, and spices in water for an hour. Alternatively, low-sodium store-bought broth works well. If you want a richer flavor, consider adding a splash of white wine or using a mushroom broth. For a quick substitute, dissolve vegetable bouillon cubes in hot water."},{"name":"lactose-free cream","advice":"Lactose-free cream provides richness and creaminess without lactose. You can substitute it with coconut cream or cashew cream for a dairy-free alternative, but this will alter the flavor slightly. For a lighter option, use lactose-free milk or a blend of milk and unsweetened almond milk with a bit of cornstarch for thickness."},{"name":"mushrooms (sliced)","advice":"Mushrooms add umami and depth to your risotto. Use a mix of button, cremini, or shiitake mushrooms for varied flavors. If you’re out of fresh mushrooms, dried mushrooms reconstituted in warm water can work in a pinch. Just be sure to strain the soaking liquid and add it to the broth for extra flavor."},{"name":"onion (finely chopped)","advice":"Onions add sweetness and depth of flavor. You can substitute with shallots for a milder taste or leeks for a more delicate flavor. If you're in a hurry, use onion powder (1 tablespoon) or even green onions, but add them later in the cooking process to avoid overcooking."},{"name":"garlic (minced)","advice":"Garlic enhances the flavor profile of the dish. Fresh garlic is best, but if you don't have any, you can use garlic powder (1/4 teaspoon for every clove). Be careful not to burn the garlic while sautéing; add it after the onions are translucent."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Olive oil helps to sauté the vegetables and adds richness. If you want a different flavor, you can use unsalted butter (if lactose isn't a concern), avocado oil, or even flavored oils like garlic-infused oil for an extra kick."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Salt is crucial for enhancing flavors. Start with a little, especially if using store-bought broth, which can be salty. Taste as you go, and remember that you can always add more but can't take it out!"},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly cracked black pepper adds heat and flavor. If you want a different flavor profile, you can use white pepper for a milder taste or even smoked paprika for a unique twist."},{"name":"fresh parsley (chopped)","advice":"Fresh parsley adds a pop of color and freshness. If you don’t have parsley, you can substitute with fresh basil or chives. For a more intense flavor, consider adding a sprinkle of lemon zest or a squeeze of lemon juice just before serving."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673ace0a4260099cc64fd5f9","name":"Lactose-Free Creamy Mushroom Risotto","ingredients":[{"name":"arborio rice","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673ace0d4260099cc64fd610"},{"name":"vegetable broth","quantity":"4 cups","_id":"673ace0d4260099cc64fd611"},{"name":"lactose-free cream","quantity":"1/2 cup","_id":"673ace0d4260099cc64fd612"},{"name":"mushrooms (sliced)","quantity":"2 cups","_id":"673ace0d4260099cc64fd613"},{"name":"onion (finely chopped)","quantity":"1","_id":"673ace0d4260099cc64fd614"},{"name":"garlic (minced)","quantity":"2 cloves","_id":"673ace0d4260099cc64fd615"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"673ace0d4260099cc64fd616"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673ace0d4260099cc64fd617"},{"name":"black pepper","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673ace0d4260099cc64fd618"},{"name":"fresh parsley (chopped)","quantity":"for garnish","_id":"673ace0d4260099cc64fd619"}],"calories":350,"allergens":["Mushrooms"],"dietaryTags":["Vegetarian","Lactose-Free"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":12.5,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":30,"tags":["Risotto","Comfort Food","Easy Recipe"],"quickTastyDescription":"A rich and creamy risotto made with earthy mushrooms and lactose-free ingredients, perfect for a comforting meal.","detailedCookingInstructions":["Heat the vegetable broth in a pot and keep it warm over low heat.","In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
