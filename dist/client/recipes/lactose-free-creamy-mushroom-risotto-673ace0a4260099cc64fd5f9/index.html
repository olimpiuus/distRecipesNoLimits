If you don&#x27;t have Arborio rice, you can substitute it with Carnaroli or Vialone Nano, which are also high-starch. In a pinch, you can use sushi rice or even a medium-grain white rice, but the texture may vary slightly. Make sure to rinse the rice before cooking to remove excess starch if you choose a non-Arborio option.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">vegetable broth</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Vegetable broth is essential for flavor in risotto. You can make your own by simmering vegetable scraps, herbs, and spices in water for an hour. Alternatively, low-sodium store-bought broth works well. If you want a richer flavor, consider adding a splash of white wine or using a mushroom broth. For a quick substitute, dissolve vegetable bouillon cubes in hot water.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">lactose-free cream</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Lactose-free cream provides richness and creaminess without lactose. You can substitute it with coconut cream or cashew cream for a dairy-free alternative, but this will alter the flavor slightly. For a lighter option, use lactose-free milk or a blend of milk and unsweetened almond milk with a bit of cornstarch for thickness.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">mushrooms (sliced)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Mushrooms add umami and depth to your risotto. Use a mix of button, cremini, or shiitake mushrooms for varied flavors. If you’re out of fresh mushrooms, dried mushrooms reconstituted in warm water can work in a pinch. Just be sure to strain the soaking liquid and add it to the broth for extra flavor.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">onion (finely chopped)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Onions add sweetness and depth of flavor. You can substitute with shallots for a milder taste or leeks for a more delicate flavor. If you&#x27;re in a hurry, use onion powder (1 tablespoon) or even green onions, but add them later in the cooking process to avoid overcooking.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">garlic (minced)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Garlic enhances the flavor profile of the dish. Fresh garlic is best, but if you don&#x27;t have any, you can use garlic powder (1/4 teaspoon for every clove). Be careful not to burn the garlic while sautéing; add it after the onions are translucent.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">olive oil</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Olive oil helps to sauté the vegetables and adds richness. If you want a different flavor, you can use unsalted butter (if lactose isn&#x27;t a concern), avocado oil, or even flavored oils like garlic-infused oil for an extra kick.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">salt</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Salt is crucial for enhancing flavors. Start with a little, especially if using store-bought broth, which can be salty. Taste as you go, and remember that you can always add more but can&#x27;t take it out!</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">black pepper</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Freshly cracked black pepper adds heat and flavor. If you want a different flavor profile, you can use white pepper for a milder taste or even smoked paprika for a unique twist.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">fresh parsley (chopped)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Fresh parsley adds a pop of color and freshness. If you don’t have parsley, you can substitute with fresh basil or chives.

If you don't have Arborio rice, you can substitute it with Carnaroli or Vialone Nano, which are also high-starch. In a pinch, you can use sushi rice or even a medium-grain white rice, but the texture may vary slightly. Make sure to rinse the rice before cooking to remove excess starch if you choose a non-Arborio option."},{"name":"vegetable broth","advice":"Vegetable broth is essential for flavor in risotto. You can make your own by simmering vegetable scraps, herbs, and spices in water for an hour. Alternatively, low-sodium store-bought broth works well. If you want a richer flavor, consider adding a splash of white wine or using a mushroom broth. For a quick substitute, dissolve vegetable bouillon cubes in hot water."},{"name":"lactose-free cream","advice":"Lactose-free cream provides richness and creaminess without lactose. You can substitute it with coconut cream or cashew cream for a dairy-free alternative, but this will alter the flavor slightly. For a lighter option, use lactose-free milk or a blend of milk and unsweetened almond milk with a bit of cornstarch for thickness."},{"name":"mushrooms (sliced)","advice":"Mushrooms add umami and depth to your risotto. Use a mix of button, cremini, or shiitake mushrooms for varied flavors. If you’re out of fresh mushrooms, dried mushrooms reconstituted in warm water can work in a pinch. Just be sure to strain the soaking liquid and add it to the broth for extra flavor."},{"name":"onion (finely chopped)","advice":"Onions add sweetness and depth of flavor. You can substitute with shallots for a milder taste or leeks for a more delicate flavor. If you're in a hurry, use onion powder (1 tablespoon) or even green onions, but add them later in the cooking process to avoid overcooking."},{"name":"garlic (minced)","advice":"Garlic enhances the flavor profile of the dish. Fresh garlic is best, but if you don't have any, you can use garlic powder (1/4 teaspoon for every clove). Be careful not to burn the garlic while sautéing; add it after the onions are translucent."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Olive oil helps to sauté the vegetables and adds richness. If you want a different flavor, you can use unsalted butter (if lactose isn't a concern), avocado oil, or even flavored oils like garlic-infused oil for an extra kick."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Salt is crucial for enhancing flavors. Start with a little, especially if using store-bought broth, which can be salty. Taste as you go, and remember that you can always add more but can't take it out!"},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly cracked black pepper adds heat and flavor. If you want a different flavor profile, you can use white pepper for a milder taste or even smoked paprika for a unique twist."},{"name":"fresh parsley (chopped)","advice":"Fresh parsley adds a pop of color and freshness. If you don’t have parsley, you can substitute with fresh basil or chives.
