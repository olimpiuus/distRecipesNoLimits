Additionally, serve alongside green bean casserole or cranberry sauce to add a touch of brightness and acidity. For beverages, consider a crisp white wine like Sauvignon Blanc or a light-bodied red like Pinot Noir, which will enhance the herbs' flavors without overpowering the dish.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the stuffing warm, directly from the oven, for the best flavor and texture. You can place it in a beautiful serving dish to add a touch of elegance to your table. For a more rustic presentation, serve it in the baking dish. Consider garnishing with additional chopped fresh parsley or a sprinkle of toasted pine nuts for added texture. A side of gravy can also enhance the dish, providing moisture and richness.","dietary_considerations":"This Classic Bread Stuffing can be made gluten-free by using gluten-free bread.

It holds up well when cubed and mixed with broth."},{"question":"How do I cube the bread properly?","answer":"Cut the loaf into even slices, then stack a few slices and cut them into strips. Finally, cut across the strips to create cubes."},{"question":"What can I do if my bread is stale?","answer":"Stale bread is perfect for stuffing! It absorbs the broth better. If it’s too hard, you can toast it lightly in the oven to dry it out further."},{"question":"How can I tell when the vegetables are done cooking?","answer":"Cook the onions and celery until they are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.

You can always add more, but it’s hard to fix if it’s too soggy or dry."},{"question":"Can I prepare the stuffing ahead of time?","answer":"Yes! You can assemble the stuffing in the baking dish, cover it, and refrigerate it for a day. Just add a bit of extra broth if it seems dry before baking."},{"question":"What should I do if I don't have fresh parsley?","answer":"Dried parsley can be used instead of fresh. Use about 1 tablespoon of dried parsley, but add it in with the other dried herbs."},{"question":"How do I know when the stuffing is done baking?","answer":"The stuffing is ready when it’s golden brown on top and heated through. You can check the center with a fork; it should feel firm and hot."},{"question":"Is it safe to leave stuffing out at room temperature?","answer":"No, it’s best to store leftover stuffing in the refrigerator within two hours of cooking to prevent bacterial growth."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"bread (french or italian)","advice":"For the best texture, use stale or day-old bread to absorb the broth without becoming mushy. If you don't have French or Italian bread, you can substitute with sourdough or whole wheat bread for a different flavor profile. Consider toasting the bread cubes in the oven for a few minutes before adding them to the stuffing for extra crunch."},{"name":"butter","advice":"Butter adds richness to the stuffing. If you're looking for a healthier option, you can substitute with olive oil or a plant-based butter. For a more complex flavor, try using herb-infused butter."},{"name":"onion","advice":"Onions add sweetness and depth to the stuffing.

If you're out of celery, you can substitute with chopped bell peppers for a different texture and flavor. Adding some fennel can also provide a nice anise flavor."},{"name":"chicken or vegetable broth","advice":"Broth is crucial for flavor; homemade broth is best, but store-bought works fine.
