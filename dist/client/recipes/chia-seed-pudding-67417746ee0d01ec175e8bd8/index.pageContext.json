Make sure to use a bowl large enough to allow for the mixture to expand as the chia seeds absorb the liquid."},{"name":"Whisk Together","description":"Using a whisk or a spoon, mix the ingredients thoroughly until all the chia seeds are evenly distributed and the liquid is well combined. This step is crucial to prevent the chia seeds from clumping together."},{"name":"Let the Mixture Sit","description":"Allow the mixture to sit for about 10 minutes. This resting period helps the chia seeds to begin absorbing the liquid.
