Ensure you cook the pasta al dente, as it will continue to cook in the oven and prevent it from becoming mushy.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">shredded cheddar cheese</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Sharp cheddar adds a strong flavor, but feel free to mix with other cheeses like Gruyère or Monterey Jack for complexity. For a creamier texture, consider using Velveeta or a cheese sauce blend.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">milk</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Whole milk gives the creamiest results, but you can substitute with 2% milk or a non-dairy milk like almond or oat milk for a lighter version. If using non-dairy milk, ensure it is unsweetened.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">butter</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Unsalted butter is preferable so you can control the salt levels in your dish. For a healthier option, you can use olive oil or a dairy-free butter substitute.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">all-purpose flour</h3><p class="text-gray-700">This is used to thicken the cheese sauce. You can substitute with whole wheat flour for a nuttier flavor or cornstarch for a gluten-free option (use 1 tablespoon of cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons of cold water instead of flour).</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">breadcrumbs</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Panko breadcrumbs give a lighter, crunchier texture compared to regular breadcrumbs. You can also use crushed crackers or even cornflakes as a topping for added flavor.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">salt</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Adjust the salt based on the saltiness of your cheese.
