Then, cut the florets from the thick stem using a sharp knife. If the florets are large, you can cut them into smaller pieces for easier eating."},{"question":"What can I substitute for Greek yogurt in the dressing?","answer":"If you don't have Greek yogurt, you can use regular yogurt, sour cream, or even mayonnaise for a creamier dressing.

Just keep the dressing separate until you're ready to serve to maintain the crunchiness of the broccoli and sunflower seeds."},{"question":"What type of raisins work best in this salad?","answer":"Regular raisins are commonly used, but you can also opt for golden raisins for a sweeter flavor and brighter color. Both will work well!"},{"question":"How do I know how much salt and pepper to add?","answer":"Start with a small amount, like a pinch of salt and a few cracks of black pepper.

If you can, steam them lightly for a few minutes before adding to the salad, as this will enhance their color and make them slightly tender while maintaining crunch. If you need a substitute, cauliflower can work well."},{"name":"raisins","advice":"Look for plump, soft raisins to add sweetness and texture. If you want a different flavor profile, consider using dried cranberries or chopped dates. Soaking the raisins in warm water for 10 minutes can help plump them up even more."},{"name":"red onion","advice":"Red onion has a milder flavor compared to other onions, making it great for salads.

Adjust the quantity based on your sweetness preference."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Start with a small amount and adjust to taste, as the other ingredients also contribute flavor.
