Just make sure they are at room temperature. If you made them from scratch, allow them to cool completely before filling."},{"question":"How can I make sure my ricotta mixture is smooth?","answer":"To achieve a smooth mixture, make sure your ricotta cheese is at room temperature before mixing.

For freshness, consider making your own shells using a simple dough recipe and frying them until golden brown."},{"name":"ricotta cheese","advice":"Use whole milk ricotta for a creamier texture. If ricotta is too watery, drain it in a cheesecloth for a few hours before mixing. For a lighter alternative, consider using mascarpone cheese or a blend of ricotta and cream cheese."},{"name":"powdered sugar","advice":"Powdered sugar is essential for sweetness and texture.
