If you prefer a leaner option, you can use skinless chicken. For a vegetarian option, consider marinated tofu or chickpeas, though cooking times will vary.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">potatoes (baby or small)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Baby potatoes are great for roasting as they cook evenly and have a creamy texture. If unavailable, you can substitute with regular potatoes cut into quarters. For a lower-carb option, swap with cauliflower florets, but adjust cooking time as they cook faster.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">olive oil</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Use extra virgin olive oil for the best flavor, but you can substitute with avocado oil or melted butter for a different taste. If you’re looking to cut calories, use a light spray of cooking oil instead.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">garlic (minced)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Fresh garlic gives the best flavor, but you can use garlic powder in a pinch (1/8 teaspoon per clove). To mellow the flavor, roast the garlic before adding it to the chicken mix.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">dried thyme</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Dried thyme works well, but fresh thyme can provide a more vibrant flavor. Use about three times the amount if substituting. For a different profile, try using dried oregano or Italian seasoning.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">dried rosemary</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Dried rosemary can be quite potent, so ensure it&#x27;s crushed or chopped finely to release its flavor. If you have fresh rosemary, it can enhance the dish remarkably; use 2-3 times the amount. Alternatively, consider using sage for a different herbal note.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">salt</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Use kosher salt for better control over seasoning. If you prefer a lower sodium option, try using a salt substitute or reduce the amount used, but be cautious not to sacrifice flavor.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">black pepper</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Freshly ground black pepper will elevate the flavor more than pre-ground. If you like a bit of heat, consider adding crushed red pepper flakes for an extra kick.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">lemon (sliced)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Lemon adds brightness to the dish. For a deeper flavor, consider using Meyer lemons if available. If you want a different citrus note, lime or orange slices can be a refreshing substitute.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">fresh parsley (for garnish)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Fresh parsley adds color and a fresh flavor to the dish. If you don’t have parsley, cilantro or chives can be used as alternatives.
