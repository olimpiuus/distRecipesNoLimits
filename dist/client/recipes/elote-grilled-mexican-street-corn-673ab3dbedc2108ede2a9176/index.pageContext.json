Enjoy perfectly grilled corn topped with creamy sauce, Cotija cheese, and chili powder!","cookingSteps":[{"name":"Preheat the Grill","description":"Start by preheating your grill to medium-high heat (about 400°F to 450°F). This ensures that the corn gets a nice char without being undercooked. Tip: If using a charcoal grill, let the coals burn until they are white hot."},{"name":"Prepare the Corn","description":"Husk the corn by removing the outer green leaves and the silky threads. Rinse the corn under cold water to remove any remaining silk. Tip: If you want to enhance the flavor, soak the corn in water for about 30 minutes before grilling."},{"name":"Grill the Corn","description":"Place the corn directly on the grill grates. Cook for about 10-15 minutes, turning every few minutes to ensure even charring. You want the kernels to be tender and slightly charred. Tip: To achieve a deeper flavor, you can brush the corn with melted butter or olive oil before grilling."},{"name":"Make the Creamy Sauce","description":"In a mixing bowl, combine 1/2 cup of mayonnaise, 1/4 cup of sour cream, 2 tablespoons of lime juice, and a pinch of salt. Mix well until smooth. This creamy sauce adds richness and flavor to the corn. Tip: For an extra kick, add a dash of hot sauce or cayenne pepper to the mixture."},{"name":"Apply the Sauce","description":"Once the corn is perfectly grilled, remove it from the grill and immediately brush it generously with the creamy sauce you prepared earlier. Make sure to coat all sides for maximum flavor."},{"name":"Add Toppings","description":"Sprinkle 1/2 cup of crumbled Cotija cheese and 1 teaspoon of chili powder over the coated corn while it's still warm. The heat will slightly melt the cheese and help it stick. Tip: For a twist, try using feta cheese if Cotija is unavailable."},{"name":"Garnish and Serve","description":"If desired, garnish the corn with fresh cilantro before serving. Serve immediately while hot to enjoy the full flavor. Tip: Elote is best enjoyed fresh off the grill, but you can also serve it sliced off the cob as a salad!"}],"pairings":{"pairings":"Pair the elote with grilled meats such as chicken, steak, or shrimp for a complete meal. For beverages, consider serving with a refreshing Mexican lager like Corona or Modelo, or a classic margarita to complement the flavors. A light, fruity sangria can also enhance the meal.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the elote directly on a platter, garnished with additional Cotija cheese and chili powder for an impressive presentation. Offer lime wedges on the side for an extra burst of flavor. For a fun twist, serve it on skewers for easy eating at parties or barbecues. Consider pairing the elote with a side of tortilla chips and salsa for a full snack spread.","dietary_considerations":"This dish can be made vegetarian-friendly by using a plant-based mayonnaise and ensuring the Cotija cheese is sourced from a non-animal rennet. For a dairy-free version, substitute the sour cream with a coconut or cashew-based alternative, and use a dairy-free cheese option."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I husk corn on the cob?","answer":"To husk corn, simply grab the top of the ear and pull down the husks towards the base. Make sure to remove all the green leaves and silk strands. Rinse the corn under cold water if you like to remove any remaining silk."},{"question":"What is the best way to grill corn?","answer":"Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Place the husked corn directly on the grill grates and cook for about 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally until it is nicely charred and cooked through. This will give the corn a delicious smoky flavor."},{"question":"How do I know when the corn is done grilling?","answer":"Corn is done grilling when it is tender and has a nice char on the outside. You can check doneness by piercing a kernel with a knife; it should be juicy and tender."},{"question":"What can I use instead of Cotija cheese?","answer":"If you can't find Cotija cheese, you can substitute it with feta cheese or queso fresco. Both will give you a similar tangy flavor."},{"question":"Can I make the creamy sauce in advance?","answer":"Yes! You can mix the mayonnaise, sour cream, lime juice, and salt in advance. Just store it in the refrigerator until you're ready to use it."},{"question":"How do I prevent the corn from burning on the grill?","answer":"To prevent burning, turn the corn every few minutes and keep an eye on it. You can also wrap the corn in aluminum foil if you're concerned about direct heat."},{"question":"What’s the best way to serve elote?","answer":"Serve elote immediately after grilling. Brush it generously with the creamy sauce, then sprinkle with Cotija cheese and chili powder. Add fresh cilantro for an extra burst of flavor!"},{"question":"Is it safe to eat corn that has been grilled too long?","answer":"While overcooked corn may be tough or dry, it is generally safe to eat. However, try to avoid charring it too much, as burnt food can have harmful compounds."},{"question":"Can I use frozen corn for elote?","answer":"Frozen corn is not ideal for this recipe since elote is traditionally made with fresh corn. If you must use frozen, try grilling the corn on the cob or using it in a different recipe."},{"question":"How do I store leftover elote?","answer":"If you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat briefly on the grill or in the microwave before serving."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"corn on the cob","advice":"Choose fresh, sweet corn for the best flavor. Look for ears with bright green husks and plump kernels. If fresh corn is not available, you can use frozen corn, but grilling it will not provide the same smoky flavor. For a different twist, you could also try using mini corn cobs."},{"name":"mayonnaise","advice":"Mayonnaise adds creaminess and helps the cheese stick to the corn. If you're looking for a healthier option, Greek yogurt can be used as a substitute. For a vegan version, consider using vegan mayonnaise or a mixture of cashew cream."},{"name":"sour cream","advice":"Sour cream adds tanginess to the sauce. If you want a lighter option, you can use plain yogurt instead. For a dairy-free alternative, try using coconut cream or a non-dairy sour cream."},{"name":"cotija cheese","advice":"Cotija cheese provides a salty, crumbly texture that is essential to elote. If you can't find cotija, you can substitute with feta cheese or queso fresco, though these will slightly alter the flavor. For a vegan option, try using a cashew-based cheese."},{"name":"chili powder","advice":"Chili powder adds spice and depth of flavor. You can adjust the amount based on your heat preference. If you're looking for more heat, consider using cayenne pepper or a spicier chili powder. For a milder flavor, use paprika instead."},{"name":"lime juice","advice":"Fresh lime juice brightens up the dish and balances the richness of the mayonnaise and cheese. Always use fresh lime juice for the best flavor. If limes are not available, lemon juice can be a good substitute."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Salt enhances the flavors of the dish. Start with a small amount and adjust to your taste, especially since cotija cheese can be salty. You might also consider using flavored salts like garlic or lime salt for an extra kick."},{"name":"fresh cilantro (optional)","advice":"Cilantro adds a fresh, herbaceous note to the dish. If you don't like cilantro, you can substitute with parsley for a similar look without the strong flavor. Chopped green onions can also add a nice touch."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673ab3dbedc2108ede2a9176","name":"Elote - Grilled Mexican Street Corn","ingredients":[{"name":"corn on the cob","quantity":"4 ears","_id":"673ab3ddedc2108ede2a917d"},{"name":"mayonnaise","quantity":"1/2 cup","_id":"673ab3ddedc2108ede2a917e"},{"name":"sour cream","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"673ab3ddedc2108ede2a917f"},{"name":"cotija cheese","quantity":"1/2 cup, crumbled","_id":"673ab3ddedc2108ede2a9180"},{"name":"chili powder","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"673ab3ddedc2108ede2a9181"},{"name":"lime juice","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"673ab3ddedc2108ede2a9182"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673ab3ddedc2108ede2a9183"},{"name":"fresh cilantro (optional)","quantity":"for garnish","_id":"673ab3ddedc2108ede2a9184"}],"calories":200,"allergens":["Dairy","Eggs"],"dietaryTags":["Vegetarian"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":10,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":15,"tags":["Grill","Snack","Mexican"],"quickTastyDescription":"Deliciously grilled corn on the cob slathered in creamy sauce and topped with cheese and spices for a mouthwatering treat!","detailedCookingInstructions":["Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.","Husk the corn and remove any silk.
