If fresh cranberries are unavailable, you can substitute with frozen cranberries; just thaw them beforehand and adjust cooking time slightly as they may release more liquid.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">sugar</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Granulated sugar is standard for sweetness, but you can substitute with brown sugar for a deeper flavor, or use honey or maple syrup for natural sweetness. If looking to reduce sugar, consider using a sugar substitute, but check the conversion ratio as they can vary.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">water</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Water is used to dissolve the sugar and cook the cranberries. You can enhance the flavor by substituting some or all of the water with orange juice or apple juice for a fruity note.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">fresh ginger, grated</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Fresh ginger adds a spicy and aromatic flavor. If fresh ginger is not available, you can use ground ginger, but use about 1/3 of the amount since it&#x27;s more concentrated. To make peeling easier, try using the edge of a spoon.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">lemon juice</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Fresh lemon juice brightens the flavor of the sauce. If you don’t have fresh lemons, bottled lemon juice can work, but be cautious as it may have preservatives which can alter the taste. For a twist, consider adding a splash of orange juice or zest for additional citrus flavor.</p></div></div></section><section class="mb-12 text-justify"><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8 text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500 to-orange-600">Cooking Steps</h2><ul class="space-y-6"><li id="coocking-step-prepare-the-cranberries" class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-orange-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-800">Step <!-- -->1<!-- -->: <span class="text-orange-600">Prepare the Cranberries</span></h3><div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span>Rinse the fresh cranberries under cold running water.
