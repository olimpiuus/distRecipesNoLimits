Rinse them under cold running water to remove excess sodium and any canning liquid. This helps improve the flavor."},{"question":"What’s the best way to chop vegetables like cucumber and red onion?","answer":"For cucumbers, cut off the ends, then slice them in half lengthwise. Lay the halves flat and cut them into half-moons or dice them as desired. For red onion, cut it in half from root to tip, peel off the skin, and make thin slices or dice by cutting perpendicular to your slices."},{"question":"How do I know how much salt and pepper to use?","answer":"Start with a small amount, such as a pinch of salt and a few cracks of black pepper. Taste your salad after mixing the dressing in. You can always add more, but it’s hard to fix if you add too much!"},{"question":"What if I don’t have fresh parsley?","answer":"If you don’t have fresh parsley, you can substitute it with other fresh herbs like cilantro or basil, or simply leave it out. The salad will still taste great!"},{"question":"Is it okay to make the salad ahead of time?","answer":"Yes, you can make the salad ahead of time! Just keep it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.

If you prefer fresh, you can substitute with cooked dried chickpeas (about 1.5 cups cooked). To cook dried chickpeas, soak them overnight and then boil for 1-2 hours until tender."},{"name":"cherry tomatoes","advice":"Use ripe, juicy cherry tomatoes for the best flavor. If cherry tomatoes are not available, you can substitute with grape tomatoes or even diced regular tomatoes. To enhance their sweetness, you can roast them in the oven for about 15-20 minutes at 400°F before adding them to the salad."},{"name":"cucumber","advice":"Choose a firm cucumber with unblemished skin. English cucumbers are a great choice as they have fewer seeds and a thinner skin. If you’re looking for a different flavor, try using a Persian cucumber or even a zucchini for a twist; just slice it thinly."},{"name":"red onion","advice":"Red onion adds a nice bite and color to the salad. If you find the flavor too strong, soak the chopped onion in cold water for 10 minutes to mellow its sharpness. For a sweeter option, consider using sweet onions like Vidalia."},{"name":"fresh parsley","advice":"Fresh parsley adds a bright, herbaceous note to the salad. If you don’t have parsley, you could substitute with other fresh herbs like cilantro or basil for a different flavor profile.

If you want a different flavor, consider substituting with avocado oil or a flavored oil, like garlic-infused olive oil. For a lighter dressing, you can mix in a little water or lemon juice."},{"name":"lemon juice","advice":"Fresh lemon juice is always best for flavor. If you don’t have fresh lemons, bottled lemon juice can work but may lack the brightness. For a different acidity, try using vinegar (like red wine or apple cider vinegar) in a 1:1 ratio."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Salt enhances the flavor of the salad; start with a small amount and add more to taste after combining all ingredients. If you're watching your sodium intake, consider using a salt substitute or seasoning blend with herbs and spices."},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly cracked black pepper adds a nice kick. If you want to experiment, try adding other spices like smoked paprika or cayenne for a bit of heat. For a milder flavor, use white pepper instead."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673ace7880ce9cf1e25c4685","name":"Chickpea Salad","ingredients":[{"name":"canned chickpeas","quantity":"1 can (15 oz)","_id":"673ace7a80ce9cf1e25c4698"},{"name":"cherry tomatoes","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673ace7a80ce9cf1e25c4699"},{"name":"cucumber","quantity":"1 medium","_id":"673ace7a80ce9cf1e25c469a"},{"name":"red onion","quantity":"1/4 medium","_id":"673ace7a80ce9cf1e25c469b"},{"name":"fresh parsley","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"673ace7a80ce9cf1e25c469c"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"673ace7a80ce9cf1e25c469d"},{"name":"lemon juice","quantity":"1 tablespoon","_id":"673ace7a80ce9cf1e25c469e"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673ace7a80ce9cf1e25c469f"},{"name":"black pepper","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673ace7a80ce9cf1e25c46a0"}],"calories":200,"allergens":[],"dietaryTags":["Vegetarian","Gluten-Free","Vegan"],"difficultyPercent":10,"price":5,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":0,"tags":["Healthy","Quick","Salad"],"quickTastyDescription":"A refreshing and protein-packed salad that’s perfect for a light meal or side dish.","detailedCookingInstructions":["Open the can of chickpeas and rinse them under cold water.","In a large bowl, combine the rinsed chickpeas, halved cherry tomatoes, diced cucumber, finely chopped red onion, and chopped parsley.","In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper to make the dressing.","Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine everything evenly.","Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.
