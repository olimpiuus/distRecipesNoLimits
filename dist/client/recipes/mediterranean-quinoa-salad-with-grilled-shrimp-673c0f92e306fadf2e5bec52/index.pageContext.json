This step is crucial for achieving a pleasant flavor. In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa with 2 cups of water and a pinch of salt. Bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes or until all the water is absorbed. Once cooked, fluff the quinoa with a fork and set it aside to cool."},{"name":"Preheat the Grill","description":"While the quinoa is cooking, preheat your grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.

Let them marinate for about 10 minutes if time allows, as this enhances the flavor."},{"name":"Grill the Shrimp","description":"Place the shrimp on the preheated grill. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side until they turn opaque and have nice grill marks. Be careful not to overcook them, as shrimp can become rubbery."},{"name":"Mix the Salad Ingredients","description":"In a large bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, 1 diced cucumber, 1 cup of halved cherry tomatoes, 1/4 finely chopped red onion, 1/2 cup of crumbled feta cheese, and 1/4 cup of chopped fresh parsley.

A side of tzatziki sauce can also enhance the Mediterranean theme.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the salad in a large, shallow bowl to showcase the vibrant colors of the ingredients.

For a vegetarian option, replace the shrimp with grilled vegetables or chickpeas. It also caters well to those looking for a high-protein meal due to the quinoa and shrimp combination."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I properly rinse and cook quinoa?","answer":"To rinse quinoa, place it in a fine mesh strainer and run it under cold water for a minute or two, stirring with your hand to ensure all grains are rinsed. To cook, use a 2:1 water-to-quinoa ratio. Bring 2 cups of water to a boil, add 1 cup of rinsed quinoa, reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook for about 15 minutes or until all water is absorbed."},{"question":"What should I look for when buying shrimp?","answer":"Choose shrimp that are firm and have a fresh, mild scent. Look for shrimp that are either peeled and deveined or ask your fishmonger to do it for you. If buying frozen, ensure they are properly sealed and free from frost."},{"question":"How do I know when the shrimp is cooked?","answer":"Cooked shrimp will turn opaque and pink, and their flesh will be firm to the touch. A good rule of thumb is to grill them for 2-3 minutes on each side."},{"question":"How can I enhance the flavor of my salad?","answer":"Using fresh herbs like parsley and a good quality olive oil will enhance the flavor significantly. You can also add a pinch of salt to each layer when combining ingredients to bring out their flavors."},{"question":"What’s the best way to chop vegetables evenly?","answer":"To chop vegetables evenly, use a sharp knife and a stable cutting board. Start by cutting the vegetable into manageable sections, then slice evenly. Practice makes perfect, so don’t worry if they aren’t perfect right away!"},{"question":"How do I prevent the quinoa from being mushy?","answer":"Make sure to rinse the quinoa thoroughly before cooking to remove the saponins, which can make it bitter. Also, avoid overcooking; once the water is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy, remove it from heat."},{"question":"Can I prepare this salad in advance?","answer":"Yes! You can prepare the quinoa and chop the vegetables ahead of time. Store them separately in the fridge, and combine them just before serving to keep everything fresh."},{"question":"What can I substitute for feta cheese if I don’t like it?","answer":"If you’re not a fan of feta, you can use crumbled goat cheese, mozzarella, or simply omit the cheese entirely for a lighter salad."},{"question":"How do I safely grill shrimp?","answer":"Ensure the grill is preheated to medium-high heat to cook the shrimp quickly. Use a grill basket or skewers to prevent them from falling through the grates. Always wash your hands and any surfaces that come into contact with raw shrimp to avoid cross-contamination."},{"question":"What else can I add to this salad?","answer":"You can add other ingredients like olives, avocado, bell peppers, or even beans for added protein and flavor. Customize it to your taste!"}],"ingredients":[{"name":"quinoa","advice":"Rinse quinoa thoroughly before cooking to remove saponins, which can impart a bitter flavor. For added flavor, consider toasting the quinoa in a dry pan for a few minutes before boiling it. If you're looking for a substitution, you can use couscous or bulgur wheat, but adjust cooking times accordingly."},{"name":"shrimp (peeled and deveined)","advice":"Choose fresh or frozen shrimp that are labeled as 'wild-caught' for better flavor. If using frozen shrimp, thaw them in the refrigerator overnight or under cold running water. For a spicy kick, marinate the shrimp with some chili powder or cayenne pepper along with olive oil and garlic."},{"name":"cucumber (diced)","advice":"Select firm cucumbers without blemishes for the best crunch. To reduce wateryness, you can remove the seeds or peel the cucumber before dicing. Alternatively, you can substitute with zucchini for a different texture."},{"name":"cherry tomatoes (halved)","advice":"Choose ripe, vibrant tomatoes for the best flavor. For an extra burst of sweetness, consider roasting the tomatoes in the oven for a few minutes before adding them to the salad. If cherry tomatoes are unavailable, grape tomatoes or even diced larger tomatoes can work well."},{"name":"red onion (finely chopped)","advice":"To reduce the sharpness of the red onion, soak the chopped onion in cold water for 10-15 minutes, then drain. You can substitute with shallots for a milder flavor, or green onions for a different taste."},{"name":"feta cheese (crumbled)","advice":"Opt for high-quality feta for the best flavor; sheep's milk feta tends to be creamier and more flavorful. If you're looking for a dairy-free option, try a vegan feta made from nuts. For a twist, consider adding crumbled goat cheese or blue cheese instead."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Use extra virgin olive oil for its rich flavor and health benefits. For a different flavor profile, try using avocado oil or a flavored oil like garlic-infused olive oil. Make sure to taste the oil before using to ensure it’s fresh."},{"name":"lemon juice","advice":"Freshly squeezed lemon juice will enhance the salad's brightness; bottled juice can be too acidic. For an alternative, lime juice can be used for a different citrus note, or you can add a splash of apple cider vinegar for tang."},{"name":"garlic (minced)","advice":"Fresh garlic will provide the best flavor; if you prefer a milder taste, you can roast the garlic beforehand. If you need a substitute, garlic powder can be used, but adjust quantity since it is more concentrated."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Use kosher salt for better control over seasoning, as it’s less salty by volume than table salt. Sea salt can also be used for a different mineral flavor. Always taste before adding more to avoid over-salting."},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly ground black pepper adds a more complex flavor than pre-ground. For a twist, experiment with different types of peppercorns, such as white or pink peppercorns, to vary the taste."},{"name":"fresh parsley (chopped)","advice":"Use flat-leaf parsley for a more robust flavor compared to curly parsley. If parsley is unavailable, you can substitute with fresh cilantro or basil for a different herbaceous note."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673c0f92e306fadf2e5bec52","name":"Mediterranean Quinoa Salad with Grilled Shrimp","ingredients":[{"name":"quinoa","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673c0f95e306fadf2e5bec6b"},{"name":"shrimp (peeled and deveined)","quantity":"1 pound","_id":"673c0f95e306fadf2e5bec6c"},{"name":"cucumber (diced)","quantity":"1","_id":"673c0f95e306fadf2e5bec6d"},{"name":"cherry tomatoes (halved)","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673c0f95e306fadf2e5bec6e"},{"name":"red onion (finely chopped)","quantity":"1/4","_id":"673c0f95e306fadf2e5bec6f"},{"name":"feta cheese (crumbled)","quantity":"1/2 cup","_id":"673c0f95e306fadf2e5bec70"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"3 tablespoons","_id":"673c0f95e306fadf2e5bec71"},{"name":"lemon juice","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"673c0f95e306fadf2e5bec72"},{"name":"garlic (minced)","quantity":"2 cloves","_id":"673c0f95e306fadf2e5bec73"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673c0f95e306fadf2e5bec74"},{"name":"black pepper","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673c0f95e306fadf2e5bec75"},{"name":"fresh parsley (chopped)","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"673c0f95e306fadf2e5bec76"}],"calories":450,"allergens":["Shellfish","Dairy"],"dietaryTags":["Gluten-Free","High-Protein","Low-Carb"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":12.5,"preparationTime":15,"cookingTime":10,"tags":["Healthy","Quick","Salad"],"quickTastyDescription":"A refreshing and nutritious salad with quinoa, vibrant vegetables, and succulent grilled shrimp, perfect for a light meal.","detailedCookingInstructions":["Rinse quinoa under cold water and cook according to package instructions (usually 2 cups water for 1 cup quinoa, bring to boil, then simmer for 15 minutes).","While quinoa cooks, preheat grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.","In a bowl, toss shrimp with olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper.","Grill shrimp for 2-3 minutes on each side until opaque and cooked through.","In a large bowl, combine cooked quinoa, diced cucumber, cherry tomatoes, red onion, feta cheese, and chopped parsley.","Drizzle with lemon juice and additional olive oil, then toss to combine.","Top the salad with grilled shrimp and serve immediately."],"createdByModel":"4o","detailedName":"Mediterranean Quinoa Salad with Grilled Shrimp","baseMeal":"Quinoa Salad","modifiersForBase":"with Grilled Shrimp","imageUrl":"/images/mediterranean-quinoa-salad-with-grilled-shrimp-673c0f92e306fadf2e5bec56.webp","image":"673c0f92e306fadf2e5bec56","servings":4,"cuisine":["Mediterranean"],"course":["Salad","Main Course"],"dateCreated":"2024-11-19T04:09:57.146Z","createdAt":"2024-11-19T04:09:57.147Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-19T05:35:49.941Z","__v":0,"mealUrl":"mediterranean-quinoa-salad-with-grilled-shrimp-673c0f92e306fadf2e5bec52"},"__v":0}}
