For added flavor, consider toasting the quinoa in a dry pan for a few minutes before boiling it. If you&#x27;re looking for a substitution, you can use couscous or bulgur wheat, but adjust cooking times accordingly.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">shrimp (peeled and deveined)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Choose fresh or frozen shrimp that are labeled as &#x27;wild-caught&#x27; for better flavor. If using frozen shrimp, thaw them in the refrigerator overnight or under cold running water. For a spicy kick, marinate the shrimp with some chili powder or cayenne pepper along with olive oil and garlic.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">cucumber (diced)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Select firm cucumbers without blemishes for the best crunch. To reduce wateryness, you can remove the seeds or peel the cucumber before dicing. Alternatively, you can substitute with zucchini for a different texture.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">cherry tomatoes (halved)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Choose ripe, vibrant tomatoes for the best flavor. For an extra burst of sweetness, consider roasting the tomatoes in the oven for a few minutes before adding them to the salad. If cherry tomatoes are unavailable, grape tomatoes or even diced larger tomatoes can work well.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">red onion (finely chopped)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">To reduce the sharpness of the red onion, soak the chopped onion in cold water for 10-15 minutes, then drain. You can substitute with shallots for a milder flavor, or green onions for a different taste.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">feta cheese (crumbled)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Opt for high-quality feta for the best flavor; sheep&#x27;s milk feta tends to be creamier and more flavorful. If you&#x27;re looking for a dairy-free option, try a vegan feta made from nuts. For a twist, consider adding crumbled goat cheese or blue cheese instead.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">olive oil</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Use extra virgin olive oil for its rich flavor and health benefits. For a different flavor profile, try using avocado oil or a flavored oil like garlic-infused olive oil. Make sure to taste the oil before using to ensure it’s fresh.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">lemon juice</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Freshly squeezed lemon juice will enhance the salad&#x27;s brightness; bottled juice can be too acidic. For an alternative, lime juice can be used for a different citrus note, or you can add a splash of apple cider vinegar for tang.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">garlic (minced)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Fresh garlic will provide the best flavor; if you prefer a milder taste, you can roast the garlic beforehand. If you need a substitute, garlic powder can be used, but adjust quantity since it is more concentrated.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">salt</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Use kosher salt for better control over seasoning, as it’s less salty by volume than table salt. Sea salt can also be used for a different mineral flavor. Always taste before adding more to avoid over-salting.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">black pepper</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Freshly ground black pepper adds a more complex flavor than pre-ground.

For added flavor, consider toasting the quinoa in a dry pan for a few minutes before boiling it. If you're looking for a substitution, you can use couscous or bulgur wheat, but adjust cooking times accordingly."},{"name":"shrimp (peeled and deveined)","advice":"Choose fresh or frozen shrimp that are labeled as 'wild-caught' for better flavor.

If you need a substitute, garlic powder can be used, but adjust quantity since it is more concentrated."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Use kosher salt for better control over seasoning, as it’s less salty by volume than table salt. Sea salt can also be used for a different mineral flavor.
