Alternatively, a non-dairy version can be made with almond or coconut milk, but it may alter the flavor profile."},{"name":"dark rum","advice":"Dark rum adds rich, caramel-like flavors to the punch. If you don't have dark rum, you can substitute with spiced rum for added warmth or use a light rum blended with a small amount of molasses for a similar depth."},{"name":"ground nutmeg","advice":"Freshly grated nutmeg provides a stronger flavor than pre-ground nutmeg. If you can, use a microplane to grate whole nutmeg directly into your mixture. If you don't have nutmeg, you can substitute it with ground cinnamon or allspice, but the flavor will change slightly."},{"name":"whipped cream","advice":"For an extra touch, consider making homemade whipped cream by whipping heavy cream with a bit of powdered sugar and vanilla extract.
