Inspect them closely and remove any stems or bad berries. Only use the firm, bright red ones for the best flavor."},{"name":"Macerate the Cranberries","description":"In a mixing bowl, combine the rinsed cranberries with 1 cup of granulated sugar. Let this mixture sit for about 10 minutes. This process, known as maceration, helps to draw out the juices from the cranberries and softens their tart flavor, balancing the sweetness."},{"name":"Combine Other Ingredients","description":"After 10 minutes, add 1 can (20 oz) of drained pineapple chunks, 1 cup of mini marshmallows, and 1/2 cup of chopped pecans to the cranberry and sugar mixture. Stir gently to combine all the ingredients evenly without smashing the cranberries."},{"name":"Fold in Whipped Topping","description":"Gently fold in 1 cup of whipped topping into the mixture. Be careful not to over-mix; you want to maintain a light and fluffy texture. This will give your salad a creamy consistency."},{"name":"Chill Before Serving","description":"Transfer the cranberry salad into a serving bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to meld together and enhances the overall taste."}],"pairings":{"pairings":"This Cranberry Salad pairs beautifully with holiday roasts such as turkey or ham, providing a sweet and tart contrast to savory dishes.

For a dairy-free version, swap the whipped topping with a coconut cream or a dairy-free whipped topping alternative.

Ensure that the canned pineapple is packed in juice or water to avoid added sugars."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I properly rinse and prepare fresh cranberries?","answer":"To rinse fresh cranberries, place them in a colander and run cold water over them. Remove any stems or bad berries (those that are soft or discolored) by hand."},{"question":"Why do I need to let the cranberries and sugar sit for 10 minutes?","answer":"Letting the cranberries and sugar sit allows the cranberries to release some of their juices, which helps to create a syrup that enhances the flavor of the salad."},{"question":"How do I drain canned pineapple chunks properly?","answer":"To drain canned pineapple chunks, open the can and pour the contents into a colander or a strainer. Let it sit for a few minutes to remove excess juice, which can make your salad watery."},{"question":"What does it mean to 'fold in' the whipped topping?","answer":"Folding in means gently mixing the whipped topping into the other ingredients without deflating it. Use a spatula to lift the mixture from the bottom and fold it over the top, turning the bowl as you go."},{"question":"How long can I chill the salad before serving?","answer":"You can chill the salad for at least 30 minutes, but it can be made several hours in advance. Just keep it covered in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve."},{"question":"Can I use a different type of nut instead of pecans?","answer":"Absolutely! If you prefer, you can substitute chopped walnuts, almonds, or even sunflower seeds for a nut-free option."},{"question":"What should I do if I don’t have whipped topping?","answer":"You can use homemade whipped cream instead. Just whip heavy cream with a little sugar until soft peaks form, and then fold it into the salad like you would with the whipped topping."},{"question":"How can I make this salad healthier?","answer":"You can reduce the sugar amount or use a sugar substitute. Adding fresh fruit like diced apples or oranges can also enhance the flavor and add nutritional value."},{"question":"What’s the best way to serve this salad?","answer":"Serve the salad in a large bowl with a ladle for scooping, or in individual cups for a more elegant presentation.

For a healthier option, consider using honey, maple syrup, or a sugar substitute, but keep in mind that it may alter the texture."},{"name":"pineapple chunks (canned)","advice":"Select chunks packed in juice or light syrup for a healthier choice.
