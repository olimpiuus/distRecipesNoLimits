Providing chopsticks alongside forks can add an authentic Asian dining experience.","dietary_considerations":"For gluten-free options, substitute soy sauce with tamari or a gluten-free soy sauce alternative.

This dish can also be made low-carb by serving it over cauliflower rice."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I safely handle raw chicken?","answer":"Always wash your hands before and after handling raw chicken. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat and vegetables to avoid cross-contamination."},{"question":"What is the best way to slice chicken breast?","answer":"To slice chicken breast more easily, freeze it for about 30 minutes before slicing. This firms it up and allows for cleaner cuts. Always slice against the grain for tenderness."},{"question":"How do I know when chicken is cooked through?","answer":"The internal temperature of cooked chicken should reach 165°F (75°C). You can use a meat thermometer to check or cut into the thickest part to ensure there is no pink meat."},{"question":"What does 'stir-fry' mean?","answer":"Stir-frying is a quick cooking method that involves frying small pieces of food in a small amount of hot oil while stirring continuously. It helps to preserve the texture and color of the ingredients."},{"question":"How can I chop vegetables quickly and safely?","answer":"To chop vegetables quickly, use a sharp knife and keep your fingers curled under your knuckles for safety. Practice the 'claw grip' with your non-cutting hand to guide the vegetable while slicing."},{"question":"What can I substitute for soy sauce?","answer":"If you need a soy sauce substitute, you can use tamari (for gluten-free), coconut aminos, or a mixture of vinegar and salt.

You can also reheat them in the microwave or make a wrap or salad with the chicken stir-fry."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"chicken breast","advice":"Choose skinless, boneless chicken breasts for a lean option. If you're short on time, pre-cut chicken strips or use chicken thighs for added flavor and moisture. Marinating the chicken in soy sauce for 30 minutes can enhance its flavor and tenderness."},{"name":"bell peppers","advice":"Use a mix of colors (red, yellow, green) for a visually appealing dish and a variety of flavors. If bell peppers are unavailable, you can substitute with other crunchy vegetables like snap peas or carrots."},{"name":"broccoli florets","advice":"Fresh broccoli is best, but frozen florets can work in a pinch. To enhance the broccoli's flavor, you can blanch it briefly before adding it to the stir-fry. This helps maintain its bright color and crisp texture."},{"name":"soy sauce","advice":"Use low-sodium soy sauce if you're watching your sodium intake. For a gluten-free option, look for tamari or coconut aminos. Adding a splash of rice vinegar can brighten the flavors."},{"name":"garlic","advice":"Fresh garlic provides the best flavor, but if you don't have it, garlic powder is a decent substitute (1/8 teaspoon for each clove). To enhance its flavor, sauté the garlic briefly before adding the other ingredients."},{"name":"ginger","advice":"Fresh ginger adds a zesty kick. If unavailable, ground ginger can be used as a substitute (1/4 teaspoon for 1 teaspoon fresh). Grating the ginger will release more flavor than chopping."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"While olive oil is a healthy option, you can also use other oils with higher smoke points like canola or peanut oil for stir-frying. Adding a drop of sesame oil at the end can impart a warm, nutty flavor."},{"name":"cornstarch","advice":"Cornstarch is used to thicken sauces. If you don't have it, arrowroot powder or tapioca starch can be used as substitutes. Mix cornstarch with cold water to avoid clumping before adding to the sauce."},{"name":"water","advice":"Water is used to adjust the sauce consistency. You can replace it with chicken broth for additional flavor. If you want a thicker sauce, reduce the amount of water."},{"name":"sesame seeds","advice":"Toasting sesame seeds before adding them as a garnish will enhance their nutty flavor.
