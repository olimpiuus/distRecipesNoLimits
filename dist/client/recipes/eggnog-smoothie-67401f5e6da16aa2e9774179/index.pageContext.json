It should feel soft but not mushy. If it's too green, it won't blend smoothly."},{"question":"Can I use frozen bananas instead?","answer":"Yes! Frozen bananas can add a creamier texture to your smoothie. Just peel and slice them before freezing."},{"question":"What if I don’t have nutmeg?","answer":"If you don't have nutmeg, you can use cinnamon or pumpkin spice as a substitute. They will give a different but delicious flavor."},{"question":"How can I make this smoothie healthier?","answer":"You can use low-fat yogurt or Greek yogurt for added protein. You can also add spinach or kale for extra nutrients without changing the taste much."},{"question":"Is it safe to consume raw eggnog?","answer":"If you're using commercially prepared eggnog, it's typically safe as it is pasteurized. If you're making homemade eggnog, ensure the eggs are pasteurized or cooked to reduce the risk of salmonella."},{"question":"What’s the best way to blend ingredients for a smoothie?","answer":"Start with the liquid ingredients (like eggnog) at the bottom, then add solids (like banana and yogurt) on top. This helps everything blend more smoothly."},{"question":"How can I store leftover smoothie?","answer":"You can store leftover smoothie in the fridge for up to 24 hours in an airtight container, but it’s best consumed fresh.

Blend for a few seconds, then rinse. This makes cleaning a breeze!"}],"ingredients":[{"name":"eggnog","advice":"Choose a high-quality eggnog for the best flavor. If you're looking for a non-dairy option, you can substitute with almond or oat milk mixed with a bit of vanilla extract and a pinch of nutmeg. For a lighter version, try using low-fat or reduced-sugar eggnog."},{"name":"banana","advice":"Use a ripe banana for optimal sweetness and creaminess. If you don't have bananas, you can substitute with 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce or a frozen banana for a colder beverage. For a tropical twist, you can also use mango."},{"name":"vanilla yogurt","advice":"Greek yogurt can be used for a thicker texture and added protein. If you're looking for a dairy-free option, consider coconut yogurt or almond yogurt. You can also add a bit of vanilla extract if you want to enhance the vanilla flavor."},{"name":"ice cubes","advice":"For a creamier texture, consider using frozen banana slices instead of ice cubes. If you prefer a thinner smoothie, reduce the amount of ice or use crushed ice. You can also freeze the eggnog ahead of time for an extra chilled result."},{"name":"nutmeg","advice":"Freshly grated nutmeg has a more potent flavor than pre-ground nutmeg, so consider grating it yourself if possible. If nutmeg isn't available, ground cinnamon or pumpkin spice can be used as alternatives to add warmth and flavor."},{"name":"whipped cream (optional)","advice":"For a lighter topping, you can use whipped coconut cream or a dollop of Greek yogurt.
