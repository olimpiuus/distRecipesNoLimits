This helps in even cooking."},{"name":"Season the Roast","description":"In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of olive oil, minced garlic (4 cloves), 1 tablespoon of salt, and 1 teaspoon of black pepper. Rub this mixture all over the prime rib roast, ensuring that it is thoroughly coated for maximum flavor."},{"name":"Add Fresh Herbs","description":"Place 2 sprigs of rosemary and 2 sprigs of thyme on top of the roast. These herbs will infuse the meat with aromatic flavors as it cooks."},{"name":"Prepare the Slow Cooker","description":"Pour 2 cups of beef broth into the bottom of the slow cooker.

Serve with the juices from the slow cooker, or make a quick gravy if desired."}],"pairings":{"pairings":"For an exquisite pairing with Slow Cooker Prime Rib, consider sides like creamy garlic mashed potatoes or roasted vegetables such as asparagus, carrots, or Brussels sprouts. A fresh arugula salad with a lemon vinaigrette adds a nice contrast. For beverages, a robust red wine such as a Cabernet Sauvignon or a Malbec complements the richness of the beef. If you prefer beer, opt for a stout or a porter.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the prime rib on a large wooden cutting board, garnished with fresh herbs for a rustic presentation. Accompany with a selection of sauces such as horseradish cream, chimichurri, or a rich red wine reduction. For an elegant touch, use warm plates to serve the meat, and consider slicing it in front of guests to enhance the dining experience. A light sprinkle of flaky sea salt just before serving can elevate the dish.","dietary_considerations":"This prime rib recipe is naturally gluten-free. For those with dietary restrictions, consider using low-sodium beef broth to reduce salt intake. For a more health-conscious twist, you can serve it with a side of steamed broccoli or cauliflower instead of heavier sides. If following a keto or low-carb diet, the dish fits well, as it is high in protein and healthy fats."},"faqs":[{"question":"What is a prime rib roast, and how do I select one?","answer":"A prime rib roast is a cut of beef from the rib section that is known for its tenderness and rich flavor. When selecting a roast, look for one with good marbling (the white fat running through the meat) as this will enhance flavor and juiciness. Aim for a roast that is around 3-4 lbs for slow cooking."},{"question":"How do I prepare garlic for the recipe?","answer":"To prepare garlic, simply peel the cloves by removing the outer skin. Then, you can mince them by chopping them finely with a knife. This will help release their flavor and aroma for the roast."},{"question":"What are sprigs of rosemary and thyme, and how do I use them?","answer":"Sprigs of rosemary and thyme are fresh herbs that add flavor to your dish. To use them, simply wash them, then place the whole sprigs on top of the roast. You can also strip the leaves from the stems and chop them if you prefer a more intense flavor."},{"question":"How do I know when the prime rib is done cooking?","answer":"Cooking times can vary, but the roast should be tender and reach an internal temperature of at least 130°F (54°C) for medium-rare. Using a meat thermometer is the best way to check for doneness. Remember that the meat will continue to cook slightly as it rests."},{"question":"What should I do if I don't have beef broth?","answer":"If you don't have beef broth, you can substitute it with vegetable broth or even water. However, using broth will enhance the flavor of the dish, so if possible, use what you have on hand."},{"question":"Why is resting the meat important?","answer":"Resting the meat allows the juices to redistribute, making the meat more tender and juicy when you slice it. Letting it rest for about 20 minutes before slicing is ideal."},{"question":"Can I use frozen prime rib roast?","answer":"Yes, but it's essential to thaw it completely in the refrigerator before cooking. Cooking a frozen roast can lead to uneven cooking and longer cooking times."},{"question":"How do I safely handle raw meat?","answer":"Always wash your hands before and after handling raw meat. Use separate cutting boards for meat and vegetables to avoid cross-contamination. Make sure to clean any surfaces that come into contact with raw meat."},{"question":"What can I serve with slow-cooked prime rib?","answer":"Slow-cooked prime rib pairs beautifully with mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, or a fresh salad. You can also serve it with a side of horseradish sauce or gravy made from the drippings."},{"question":"Do I need to sear the roast before slow cooking?","answer":"While searing the roast can enhance its flavor and create a nice crust, it's not necessary for slow cooking. If you're short on time, you can skip this step and still have a delicious roast!"}],"ingredients":[{"name":"prime rib roast","advice":"Choose a prime rib roast with good marbling for maximum flavor and tenderness. If you can't find prime rib, a ribeye roast can be a good substitute, though it may be slightly smaller. For a leaner option, consider a sirloin roast, but adjust cooking times accordingly as it may cook faster."},{"name":"garlic","advice":"Fresh garlic is best, but you can substitute with 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder per clove if you don't have fresh. To enhance the garlic flavor, try roasting the cloves before mincing them for a sweeter, mellower taste."},{"name":"rosemary","advice":"Fresh rosemary can be substituted with dried rosemary at a ratio of 1:3 (1 sprig of fresh is roughly equivalent to 1 teaspoon dried). To enhance the flavor, consider chopping the fresh rosemary to release more oils before adding it to the roast."},{"name":"thyme","advice":"Similar to rosemary, fresh thyme can be substituted with dried thyme, using 1:3 ratio. If using fresh, you can strip the leaves from the stems for more even distribution of flavor throughout the dish."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Extra virgin olive oil is preferred for its flavor, but if unavailable, you can substitute with canola oil or avocado oil. For added flavor, consider infusing the oil with herbs or garlic before using it to rub the roast."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Kosher salt is ideal for seasoning meat. If using table salt, reduce the amount slightly as it is more concentrated. For a different flavor twist, try using smoked salt or garlic salt."},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly cracked black pepper gives the best flavor. If you want to add some heat, consider mixing in a pinch of cayenne pepper or using a pepper blend that includes different types of peppercorns."},{"name":"beef broth","advice":"Homemade beef broth is always a great choice if you have the time. If you're looking for a lower sodium option, you can use low-sodium beef broth or even combine it with water to control the salt levels. For a richer flavor, you can add a splash of red wine or Worcestershire sauce to the broth."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"_id":"674177e8ee0d01ec175e8d83","name":"Slow Cooker Prime Rib","ingredients":[{"name":"prime rib roast","quantity":"3-4 lbs","_id":"674177ecee0d01ec175e8d8a"},{"name":"garlic","quantity":"4 cloves","_id":"674177ecee0d01ec175e8d8b"},{"name":"rosemary","quantity":"2 sprigs","_id":"674177ecee0d01ec175e8d8c"},{"name":"thyme","quantity":"2 sprigs","_id":"674177ecee0d01ec175e8d8d"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"674177ecee0d01ec175e8d8e"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"1 tablespoon","_id":"674177ecee0d01ec175e8d8f"},{"name":"black pepper","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"674177ecee0d01ec175e8d90"},{"name":"beef broth","quantity":"2 cups","_id":"674177ecee0d01ec175e8d91"}],"calories":600,"allergens":[],"dietaryTags":["gluten-free","dairy-free"],"difficultyPercent":30,"price":50,"preparationTime":15,"cookingTime":480,"tags":["easy","slow cooker","meat","comfort food"],"quickTastyDescription":"Tender and juicy prime rib roast, slow-cooked to perfection with aromatic herbs and spices.","detailedCookingInstructions":["Rub the prime rib roast with olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and black pepper.","Place the rosemary and thyme on top of the roast.","Pour beef broth into the slow cooker.","Put the roast in the slow cooker and cover it.","Cook on low for 8 hours or until the meat is tender and reaches your desired doneness.","Let it rest for 20 minutes before slicing."],"createdByModel":"4o","detailedName":"Easy Slow Cooker Prime Rib Roast","baseMeal":"Prime Rib","modifiersForBase":"Slow-cooked","imageUrl":"/images/slow-cooker-prime-rib-674177e9ee0d01ec175e8d87.webp","image":"674177e9ee0d01ec175e8d87","servings":6,"cuisine":["American","Comfort Food"],"course":["Main Course"],"mealUrl":"slow-cooker-prime-rib-674177e8ee0d01ec175e8d83","SEOLongkeywords":["slow cooker prime rib","easy prime rib recipe","tender prime rib roast","holiday prime rib","beef roast slow cooker"],"dateCreated":"2024-11-23T06:36:28.831Z","createdAt":"2024-11-23T06:36:28.833Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-23T06:36:28.833Z","__v":0},"createdAt":"2024-11-23T06:36:44.868Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-23T06:36:44.868Z","__v":0}}
