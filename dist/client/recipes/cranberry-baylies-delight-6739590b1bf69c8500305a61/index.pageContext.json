For 2 oz of Baileys, fill the jigger to the appropriate line or use a liquid measuring cup."},{"question":"How do I properly fill a glass with ice cubes?","answer":"Simply take your ice cubes from the freezer and fill the glass until it’s about three-quarters full. This allows enough space for the liquids without overflow."},{"question":"Can I use fresh cranberries instead of cranberry juice?","answer":"Fresh cranberries are quite tart and not suitable for this drink. Stick to cranberry juice for the right flavor profile."},{"question":"What if I don’t have a lime wedge?","answer":"If you don't have lime, you can substitute it with lemon for a similar citrus flavor, or simply skip the garnish."},{"question":"How should I stir the drink without damaging the ice or ingredients?","answer":"Use a long spoon and gently stir in a circular motion.

If you need a non-alcoholic substitute, consider using a mixture of heavy cream and a splash of coffee or vanilla extract. For a lower-calorie option, try using a light cream or a flavored coffee creamer. To enhance the flavor, you can chill the Baileys beforehand to keep your drink refreshing."},{"name":"Cranberry Juice","advice":"Choose 100% cranberry juice for a tart flavor or a cranberry cocktail for a sweeter option. If you're looking for a healthier substitute, you can use pomegranate juice or a mix of cranberry and soda water for a fizzy twist. To enhance the flavor, consider adding a splash of orange juice, which complements cranberry well and adds a citrusy brightness."},{"name":"Ice Cubes","advice":"Use clear ice cubes for a more aesthetically pleasing drink. You can also freeze cranberry juice in ice cube trays to add a pop of color and flavor as they melt. If you want to prevent dilution, consider using large ice cubes or ice spheres, which melt more slowly than smaller cubes."},{"name":"Lime Wedge","advice":"The lime wedge adds a refreshing zesty flavor that brightens up the drink. If you don't have fresh limes, you can use bottled lime juice, but fresh is preferable for the best taste. To enhance the lime flavor, consider rubbing the rim of the glass with lime before serving or adding a dash of lime juice directly into the drink."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"6739590b1bf69c8500305a61","name":"Cranberry Baylies Delight","ingredients":[{"name":"baileys irish cream","quantity":"2 oz","_id":"6739590d1bf69c8500305a70"},{"name":"cranberry juice","quantity":"4 oz","_id":"6739590d1bf69c8500305a71"},{"name":"ice cubes","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"6739590d1bf69c8500305a72"},{"name":"lime wedge","quantity":"1","_id":"6739590d1bf69c8500305a73"}],"calories":250,"allergens":["Dairy"],"dietaryTags":["Vegetarian","Gluten-Free"],"difficultyPercent":10,"price":5,"preparationTime":5,"cookingTime":0,"tags":["Drink","Cocktail","Easy"],"quickTastyDescription":"A refreshing and creamy drink combining the rich flavor of Baylies with tart cranberry juice.","detailedCookingInstructions":["Fill a glass with ice cubes.","Pour in 2 oz of Baileys Irish Cream.","Add 4 oz of cranberry juice on top.","Stir gently to mix the flavors.","Garnish with a lime wedge and enjoy!"],"createdByModel":"4o","detailedName":"Cranberry Baylies Delight","baseMeal":"Drink","modifiersForBase":"Chill with ice and garnish","imageUrl":"/images/cranberry-baylies-delight-6739590c1bf69c8500305a68.webp","image":"6739590c1bf69c8500305a68","servings":1,"cuisine":["American"],"course":["Beverage"],"dateCreated":"2024-11-17T02:46:37.291Z","createdAt":"2024-11-17T02:46:37.294Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-19T05:35:48.170Z","__v":0,"mealUrl":"cranberry-baylies-delight-6739590b1bf69c8500305a61"},"__v":0}}
