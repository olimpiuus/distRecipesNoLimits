For a richer experience, consider serving it with a dollop of unsweetened whipped cream or a light cream cheese frosting sweetened with a sugar substitute. A light dusting of powdered erythritol can also add a touch of sweetness without the calories. For beverages, a cup of herbal tea or a sparkling water with a splash of lemon can complement the flavors beautifully.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the Sugar-Free Sponge Cake at room temperature or slightly chilled for the best texture and flavor. For an elegant presentation, slice the cake into thin layers and stack them with layers of whipped cream and fresh fruit in between. You can also serve it as individual servings with a small portion of whipped cream and a sprinkle of nuts or seeds on top for added crunch. For a festive touch, consider garnishing with mint leaves or edible flowers, which can elevate the visual appeal of the dessert.","dietary_considerations":"This Sugar-Free Sponge Cake is suitable for those following a low-sugar or ketogenic diet due to its use of almond flour and sugar-free ingredients. It is gluten-free, making it a good option for those with gluten sensitivities. If you're catering to a dairy-free audience, you can substitute the butter with coconut oil or a dairy-free margarine and use a plant-based whipped cream for serving. Additionally, consider using a sugar substitute like stevia or monk fruit in place of the applesauce for further sugar reduction, while ensuring the moisture balance of the cake is maintained."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I know when to stop beating the eggs?","answer":"Beat the eggs until they are frothy and slightly increased in volume, which usually takes about 2-3 minutes with a hand mixer. You're looking for a light and airy texture that will help your cake rise."},{"question":"Can I use other types of flour instead of almond flour?","answer":"Yes, but keep in mind that using a different flour will change the texture and taste of the cake.
