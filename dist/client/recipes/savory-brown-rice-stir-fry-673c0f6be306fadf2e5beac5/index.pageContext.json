Combine it with 4 cups of water in a pot, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 45 minutes, or until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender. Fluff with a fork and let it sit covered for a few minutes before using."},{"question":"What can I use instead of sesame oil?","answer":"If you don't have sesame oil, you can substitute it with vegetable oil or olive oil. For a similar flavor, you can also use peanut oil."},{"question":"How do I know when the vegetables are done in a stir-fry?","answer":"Vegetables should be tender but still crisp. You can test them with a fork; they should be easy to pierce but not mushy. This usually takes about 5-7 minutes over medium-high heat."},{"question":"What is the best way to scramble eggs in a stir-fry?","answer":"To scramble eggs, push your cooked vegetables to the side of the pan and add a little more oil if needed. Crack the eggs directly into the pan, stirring gently until they are fully cooked and mixed with the vegetables."},{"question":"Can I add more protein to my stir-fry?","answer":"Absolutely! You can add cooked chicken, beef, shrimp, or tofu. Just make sure to cook the protein separately before adding it to the stir-fry, or add it at the same time as the vegetables so it heats through."},{"question":"What if I don’t have green onions?","answer":"If you don't have green onions, you can use chopped onion or shallots as an alternative. You can also leave them out and still have a delicious dish."},{"question":"How do I prevent my stir-fry from being soggy?","answer":"To prevent sogginess, make sure your pan is hot enough when you add the ingredients, and don’t overcrowd the pan. Stir-fry in batches if necessary to ensure even cooking."},{"question":"How do I enhance the flavor of my stir-fry?","answer":"You can enhance the flavor by adding a pinch of sugar, chili flakes, or a splash of vinegar (like rice vinegar or balsamic) for acidity. Fresh herbs like cilantro or basil can also add a burst of flavor."},{"question":"What’s the best way to store leftover stir-fry?","answer":"Store leftover stir-fry in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, use a skillet over medium heat or the microwave, adding a splash of water to help steam it back to life."},{"question":"How do I safely use a knife when chopping vegetables?","answer":"Always use a sharp knife for easier cutting. Hold the handle firmly, keep your fingers tucked under on the hand holding the vegetable, and use a cutting board. Practice cutting slowly until you feel more comfortable."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"brown rice","advice":"Brown rice takes longer to cook than white rice, so ensure you follow package instructions for the correct water-to-rice ratio, usually 2:1. If you're short on time, you can use pre-cooked brown rice or quick-cooking varieties. For added flavor, consider toasting the rice in the pan before cooking it."},{"name":"mixed vegetables (frozen or fresh)","advice":"Frozen mixed vegetables are convenient and retain nutrients well; no need to thaw them before adding to the pan. If using fresh vegetables, ensure to cut them evenly for uniform cooking. You can substitute with any vegetables you prefer, such as bell peppers, broccoli, or snap peas. Add vegetables that take longer to cook first."},{"name":"soy sauce","advice":"Regular soy sauce is salty and adds umami flavor; if you need a gluten-free option, use tamari or coconut aminos. For a lighter flavor, consider low-sodium soy sauce. You can also enhance the flavor by adding a dash of rice vinegar or a sprinkle of sugar."},{"name":"sesame oil","advice":"Sesame oil adds a nutty flavor; use toasted sesame oil for a stronger taste. If you don’t have sesame oil, substitute with another oil like vegetable or canola oil, then add a sprinkle of sesame seeds at the end for flavor."},{"name":"garlic (minced)","advice":"Freshly minced garlic provides the best flavor; avoid using pre-minced garlic in jars if possible. For a milder taste, you can roast the garlic before adding it to the stir-fry, or use garlic powder if fresh isn't available."},{"name":"ginger (grated)","advice":"Fresh ginger gives a zesty kick; you can substitute with ground ginger, but use less (about 1/4 teaspoon) as the flavor is more concentrated. For easier peeling, try using the edge of a spoon."},{"name":"eggs (optional)","advice":"Scrambled eggs add protein and richness; to make them fluffier, whisk them with a pinch of salt before cooking. You can substitute with tofu for a vegan option or omit entirely if you prefer a lighter dish."},{"name":"green onions (sliced)","advice":"Green onions add freshness and a mild onion flavor; both the white and green parts are edible and flavorful. If unavailable, you can substitute with chives or shallots, but adjust the quantity as they have a stronger taste."},{"name":"salt and pepper","advice":"Always season gradually and taste as you go; remember that soy sauce adds saltiness, so be cautious with additional salt. Freshly ground black pepper can enhance the dish's flavor profile more than pre-ground."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673c0f6be306fadf2e5beac5","name":"Savory Brown Rice Stir-Fry","ingredients":[{"name":"brown rice","quantity":"2 cups","_id":"673c0f6ee306fadf2e5beadb"},{"name":"mixed vegetables (frozen or fresh)","quantity":"2 cups","_id":"673c0f6ee306fadf2e5beadc"},{"name":"soy sauce","quantity":"3 tablespoons","_id":"673c0f6ee306fadf2e5beadd"},{"name":"sesame oil","quantity":"1 tablespoon","_id":"673c0f6ee306fadf2e5beade"},{"name":"garlic (minced)","quantity":"2 cloves","_id":"673c0f6ee306fadf2e5beadf"},{"name":"ginger (grated)","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"673c0f6ee306fadf2e5beae0"},{"name":"eggs (optional)","quantity":"2","_id":"673c0f6ee306fadf2e5beae1"},{"name":"green onions (sliced)","quantity":"2","_id":"673c0f6ee306fadf2e5beae2"},{"name":"salt and pepper","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673c0f6ee306fadf2e5beae3"}],"calories":350,"allergens":["Soy","Eggs (optional)"],"dietaryTags":["Vegetarian","High Fiber"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":10,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":15,"tags":["Quick","Healthy","One-Pan","Stir-Fry"],"quickTastyDescription":"A quick and delicious stir-fry packed with veggies and protein, all tossed in savory sauce over brown rice!","detailedCookingInstructions":["Cook the brown rice according to package instructions.
