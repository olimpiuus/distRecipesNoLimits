For a different flavor profile, try using just one type of berry, like strawberries or blueberries."},{"name":"banana","advice":"Bananas add natural sweetness and creaminess to smoothies.

If you're allergic to bananas or want to substitute, consider using avocado for creaminess or a few tablespoons of applesauce for sweetness."},{"name":"greek yogurt","advice":"Greek yogurt provides protein and creaminess. If you prefer a dairy-free option, use coconut yogurt or almond milk yogurt. For a tangier flavor, opt for plain yogurt, but you can also use flavored varieties for added sweetness."},{"name":"honey (optional)","advice":"Honey enhances the sweetness of the smoothie, but it can be substituted with maple syrup, agave nectar, or a sugar-free sweetener like stevia if you want to reduce sugar intake. Consider adding a dash of vanilla extract for extra flavor if you omit the honey."},{"name":"milk (dairy or plant-based)","advice":"Milk makes the smoothie drinkable and adds creaminess.
