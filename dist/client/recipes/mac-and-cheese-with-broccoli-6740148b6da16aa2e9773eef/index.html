Whether you&#x27;re making it for kids or adults, this Mac and Cheese with Broccoli will surely become a new favorite!</p><section class="mb-12 text-justify"><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8 text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-gray-700 to-gray-800">Ingredients</h2><div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6"><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">elbow macaroni</h3><p class="text-gray-700">If you don&#x27;t have elbow macaroni, you can substitute it with any small pasta shape like shells, penne, or fusilli. For a healthier option, consider whole wheat or gluten-free pasta. Make sure to cook it al dente, as it will continue to cook when mixed with the cheese sauce.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">broccoli florets</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Fresh broccoli is preferred for its crisp texture, but you can also use frozen broccoli florets. If using frozen, just microwave them for a minute or two before adding to the dish. To enhance flavor, consider sautéing the broccoli briefly in olive oil and garlic before mixing it with the mac and cheese.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">cheddar cheese (shredded)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">For the best melting properties, use a good quality sharp cheddar. You can mix in other cheeses like Gruyère, Monterey Jack, or even a bit of cream cheese for creaminess. If you&#x27;re looking for a lower-fat option, reduced-fat cheddar can work, but it may not melt as smoothly.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">milk</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Whole milk provides the creamiest texture, but you can substitute it with 2% or skim milk if desired. For a richer flavor, consider using half-and-half or adding a splash of cream. For a dairy-free version, use almond milk, coconut milk, or soy milk.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">butter</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Unsalted butter is ideal for controlling the saltiness of the dish. You can substitute with margarine or a plant-based butter for a dairy-free option. If you&#x27;re looking for a healthier fat, consider using olive oil or avocado oil.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">flour</h3><p class="text-gray-700">All-purpose flour works best for the roux, but you can substitute it with gluten-free flour or cornstarch (use half the amount) if needed. If you&#x27;re aiming for a nutty flavor, try using whole wheat flour.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">salt</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Adjust the salt to your taste, particularly if using salty cheese or broth in the recipe. You can use sea salt, kosher salt, or even garlic salt for added flavor.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">pepper</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Black pepper is traditional, but feel free to use white pepper for a milder taste or add a pinch of cayenne pepper or smoked paprika for a kick. Freshly ground pepper will elevate the flavor more than pre-ground.</p></div></div></section><section class="mb-12 text-justify"><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8 text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500 to-orange-600">Cooking Steps</h2><ul class="space-y-6"><li id="coocking-step-cook-the-elbow-macaroni" class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-orange-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-800">Step <!-- -->1<!-- -->: <span class="text-orange-600">Cook the Elbow Macaroni</span></h3><div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span>In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add a pinch of salt.
