Trim any excess fat or sinew with a sharp knife."},{"question":"What can I use instead of enchilada sauce?","answer":"You can substitute enchilada sauce with salsa or a homemade mixture of tomato sauce with spices like cumin and chili powder."},{"question":"How do I ensure my onions are diced evenly?","answer":"To dice an onion, cut it in half from top to bottom, then make horizontal and vertical cuts before chopping it into small pieces. This will help achieve even-sized pieces."},{"question":"How do I know when the chicken is fully cooked?","answer":"Chicken is fully cooked when it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C). If you don't have a meat thermometer, you can check if the chicken shreds easily with forks, indicating it's done."},{"question":"What if I don't have a slow cooker?","answer":"You can make this recipe in an oven.

If you don't have chicken breasts, chicken thighs work well for a juicier result. You can also use rotisserie chicken to save time—just shred it and add it to the slow cooker at the end."},{"name":"enchilada sauce","advice":"For a homemade touch, use a blend of tomato sauce, chili powder, cumin, and a bit of lime juice. If you're out of enchilada sauce, salsa or a combination of diced tomatoes with spices can work as a substitute."},{"name":"tortillas (corn or flour)","advice":"Corn tortillas give a traditional flavor, but if you prefer a softer texture, use flour tortillas. To prevent tearing, warm the tortillas in a dry skillet or microwave before filling."},{"name":"black beans","advice":"Choose low-sodium black beans to control salt levels. If you're out of black beans, pinto beans or kidney beans can be used as substitutes. For added flavor, rinse and sauté the beans with spices before adding them to the dish."},{"name":"corn","advice":"Fresh corn can be used if in season; just cut it off the cob. Frozen corn is a great alternative and requires no preparation. Canned corn is also acceptable—just drain and rinse to reduce sodium."},{"name":"shredded cheese (cheddar or Mexican blend)","advice":"Mix different cheeses like Monterey Jack or pepper jack for added flavor. If you're looking for a lower-fat option, use reduced-fat cheese, but keep in mind it may not melt as well."},{"name":"onion (diced)","advice":"Sweet onions like Vidalia can add a milder flavor, while yellow onions provide a classic taste. For a deeper flavor, sauté the onions before adding them to the slow cooker."},{"name":"garlic (minced)","advice":"Fresh garlic provides the best flavor, but you can use garlic powder as a substitute (1/8 teaspoon per clove). For a milder flavor, roast the garlic before mincing."},{"name":"cumin","advice":"Cumin adds a warm, earthy flavor. If you don’t have cumin, coriander can be used as a substitute, though it will change the flavor profile."},{"name":"chili powder","advice":"Adjust the amount of chili powder based on your heat preference. If you want a spicier kick, add cayenne pepper or use a hot chili powder blend."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Start with a small amount of salt, and adjust to taste at the end, especially since the enchilada sauce and cheese can be salty."},{"name":"pepper","advice":"Freshly ground black pepper enhances flavor better than pre-ground. For a twist, try using smoked pepper for a deeper taste."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673ab3a4edc2108ede2a910c","name":"Slow Cooker Mexican Chicken Enchiladas","ingredients":[{"name":"boneless chicken breasts","quantity":"2 pounds","_id":"673ab3a7edc2108ede2a9118"},{"name":"enchilada sauce","quantity":"2 cups","_id":"673ab3a7edc2108ede2a9119"},{"name":"tortillas (corn or flour)","quantity":"10","_id":"673ab3a7edc2108ede2a911a"},{"name":"black beans","quantity":"1 can (15 oz)","_id":"673ab3a7edc2108ede2a911b"},{"name":"corn","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673ab3a7edc2108ede2a911c"},{"name":"shredded cheese (cheddar or mexican blend)","quantity":"2 cups","_id":"673ab3a7edc2108ede2a911d"},{"name":"onion (diced)","quantity":"1 medium","_id":"673ab3a7edc2108ede2a911e"},{"name":"garlic (minced)","quantity":"2 cloves","_id":"673ab3a7edc2108ede2a911f"},{"name":"cumin","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"673ab3a7edc2108ede2a9120"},{"name":"chili powder","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"673ab3a7edc2108ede2a9121"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673ab3a7edc2108ede2a9122"},{"name":"pepper","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673ab3a7edc2108ede2a9123"}],"calories":400,"allergens":["dairy"],"dietaryTags":["gluten-free","high-protein"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":15,"preparationTime":15,"cookingTime":360,"tags":["slow cooker","Mexican","comfort food"],"quickTastyDescription":"Deliciously layered enchiladas cooked to perfection in a slow cooker, bursting with Mexican flavors!","detailedCookingInstructions":["Place the chicken breasts in the bottom of the slow cooker.","Pour 1 cup of enchilada sauce over the chicken.","Add the diced onion, minced garlic, cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper on top of the chicken.","Cover and cook on low for 6 hours or high for 3 hours until the chicken is fully cooked and shreds easily.","Once cooked, shred the chicken in the slow cooker with two forks.","Add the black beans and corn to the shredded chicken and mix well.","In a baking dish, spread a layer of enchilada sauce on the bottom.","Take a tortilla, fill it with the chicken mixture, sprinkle some cheese inside, roll it up, and place it seam side down in the baking dish.","Repeat with the remaining tortillas and chicken mixture.","Pour the remaining enchilada sauce over the top of the rolled enchiladas and sprinkle the remaining cheese on top.","Cover with foil and cook on low for an additional 30 minutes to melt the cheese, or until heated through."],"createdByModel":"4o","detailedName":"Slow Cooker Mexican Chicken Enchiladas","baseMeal":"Enchiladas","modifiersForBase":"Chicken and black beans","imageUrl":"/images/slow-cooker-mexican-chicken-enchiladas-673ab3a4edc2108ede2a9113.webp","image":"673ab3a4edc2108ede2a9113","servings":6,"cuisine":["Mexican"],"course":["Main Course"],"dateCreated":"2024-11-18T03:25:27.324Z","createdAt":"2024-11-18T03:25:27.327Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-19T05:35:48.861Z","__v":0,"mealUrl":"slow-cooker-mexican-chicken-enchiladas-673ab3a4edc2108ede2a910c"},"__v":0}}
