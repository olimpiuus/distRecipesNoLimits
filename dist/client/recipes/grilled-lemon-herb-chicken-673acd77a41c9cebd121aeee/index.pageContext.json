This marinade will not only flavor the chicken but also tenderize it."},{"name":"Marinate the Chicken","description":"Place the 4 pieces of chicken breasts in a large zip-top bag. Pour the prepared marinade over the chicken, ensuring it is evenly coated. Seal the bag, making sure to remove as much air as possible, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours for a more intense flavor. Marinating is key to juicy chicken!"},{"name":"Preheat the Grill","description":"While the chicken is marinating, preheat your grill to medium-high heat (about 375-450°F or 190-230°C). This ensures a nice sear and keeps the chicken juicy."},{"name":"Grill the Chicken","description":"Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the leftover marinade. Place the chicken on the grill and cook for about 6-7 minutes on each side. Use a meat thermometer to check for doneness; the internal temperature should reach 165°F (75°C). Avoid flipping the chicken too often to get those beautiful grill marks."},{"name":"Rest and Serve","description":"Once cooked, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for about 5 minutes. This resting period allows the juices to redistribute, keeping the chicken moist. After resting, slice the chicken and serve it with your favorite sides or a fresh salad."}],"pairings":{"pairings":"This Grilled Lemon Herb Chicken pairs beautifully with a variety of sides and beverages. Complement it with a fresh arugula salad drizzled with a light vinaigrette, roasted seasonal vegetables, or a quinoa salad mixed with cherry tomatoes and cucumber. For a heartier option, serve alongside garlic mashed potatoes or a wild rice pilaf. For beverages, consider a crisp white wine like Sauvignon Blanc or a light lager. For non-alcoholic options, iced herbal tea or sparkling water with a slice of lemon works nicely.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the grilled lemon herb chicken warm, sliced into strips or served whole, garnished with additional chopped parsley and lemon wedges for an extra burst of color and flavor. Create a beautiful presentation on a large platter with lemon slices and fresh herbs. For an elegant touch, drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil over the chicken just before serving. This dish is perfect for outdoor barbecues, family dinners, or casual gatherings.","dietary_considerations":"This dish is naturally gluten-free and can be made dairy-free as well. For those following a low-carb or keto diet, it fits perfectly as is. To accommodate different dietary preferences, consider marinating tofu or portobello mushrooms in the same lemon herb mixture for a vegetarian option. Additionally, serving the chicken on a bed of greens can provide a lighter meal for those seeking to limit carbs."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I prepare chicken breasts for grilling?","answer":"Start by trimming any excess fat from the chicken breasts. You can also pound them to an even thickness for even cooking. This helps them cook more uniformly and reduces the risk of drying out."},{"question":"What is the best way to marinate chicken?","answer":"Combine your marinade ingredients in a bowl and whisk them together. Place your chicken in a zip-top bag or shallow dish, pour the marinade over it, seal or cover, and refrigerate. Aim to marinate for at least 30 minutes to infuse flavor, but 2 hours is ideal for maximum taste."},{"question":"How can I tell when chicken is fully cooked?","answer":"The best way to check if chicken is done is by using a meat thermometer. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (75°C). If you don’t have a thermometer, make a cut in the thickest part of the chicken; it should be opaque and the juices should run clear."},{"question":"What should I do if I don't have a grill?","answer":"You can cook the marinated chicken in a skillet on the stove or bake it in the oven. For the skillet, heat a little oil over medium-high heat and cook the chicken for about 6-7 minutes on each side. For baking, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and bake for about 25-30 minutes."},{"question":"How can I make sure my grilled chicken stays juicy?","answer":"Marinating the chicken before grilling is key to keeping it juicy. Also, avoid overcooking it; use a timer and check for doneness with a thermometer. Letting the chicken rest for a few minutes after grilling allows the juices to redistribute, keeping it moist."},{"question":"What can I serve with grilled lemon herb chicken?","answer":"Grilled vegetables, a fresh salad, or rice are great accompaniments. You can also serve it with a light pasta or quinoa dish for a complete meal. Consider adding a slice of lemon on the side for extra flavor!"},{"question":"What utensils or tools do I need for this recipe?","answer":"You’ll need a mixing bowl for the marinade, a whisk or fork, a zip-top bag or dish for marinating, a grill or skillet, a meat thermometer, and tongs or a spatula for flipping the chicken."},{"question":"Can I use dried herbs instead of fresh?","answer":"Yes! Dried herbs are a great substitute. Use about one-third of the amount of dried herbs compared to fresh, as they are more concentrated in flavor. For this recipe, use about 1 teaspoon of dried parsley instead of 2 tablespoons of fresh."},{"question":"How do I safely handle raw chicken?","answer":"Always wash your hands before and after handling raw chicken to prevent cross-contamination. Use separate cutting boards and utensils for raw chicken and other foods. Clean and sanitize surfaces after preparing chicken."},{"question":"How long can I marinate chicken?","answer":"You can safely marinate chicken for up to 2 hours in the refrigerator. If marinating for longer than that (up to overnight), make sure to do so in the refrigerator to prevent bacterial growth."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"chicken breasts","advice":"Choose boneless, skinless chicken breasts for even cooking. If you prefer more flavor and moisture, consider using thighs instead. You can also pound the chicken to an even thickness for uniform cooking. If you have frozen chicken, ensure it's fully thawed before marinating."},{"name":"lemon juice","advice":"Freshly squeezed lemon juice is preferable for its vibrant flavor, but bottled lemon juice can be used in a pinch. To enhance the lemon flavor, consider adding some lemon zest to the marinade."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Use extra virgin olive oil for a richer flavor. If you're looking for a lighter option, you can substitute with avocado oil or canola oil. Avoid using oil with a low smoke point when grilling."},{"name":"garlic, minced","advice":"Fresh minced garlic provides the best flavor, but you can use garlic powder as a substitute (1/8 teaspoon per clove). To enhance the garlic flavor, consider roasting the garlic before adding it to the marinade."},{"name":"fresh parsley, chopped","advice":"Fresh parsley adds brightness and color; however, you can substitute with fresh cilantro or basil for a different flavor profile. If using dried parsley, use about 1 teaspoon instead of fresh."},{"name":"dried oregano","advice":"Dried oregano is convenient, but fresh oregano can elevate the dish if available. Use three times the amount of fresh oregano (1 tablespoon) if substituting. Consider adding other herbs like thyme or rosemary for added complexity."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Kosher salt is ideal for seasoning, but if using table salt, reduce the amount slightly as it is more concentrated. Flavored salts, like garlic or herb-infused salt, can add an extra layer of flavor."},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly ground black pepper provides the best flavor. If you want to add some heat, consider using crushed red pepper flakes or a dash of cayenne pepper in the marinade."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673acd77a41c9cebd121aeee","name":"Grilled Lemon Herb Chicken","ingredients":[{"name":"chicken breasts","quantity":"4 pieces","_id":"673acd79a41c9cebd121aef4"},{"name":"lemon juice","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"673acd79a41c9cebd121aef5"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"673acd79a41c9cebd121aef6"},{"name":"garlic, minced","quantity":"2 cloves","_id":"673acd79a41c9cebd121aef7"},{"name":"fresh parsley, chopped","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"673acd79a41c9cebd121aef8"},{"name":"dried oregano","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"673acd79a41c9cebd121aef9"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"673acd79a41c9cebd121aefa"},{"name":"black pepper","quantity":"1/2 teaspoon","_id":"673acd79a41c9cebd121aefb"}],"calories":350,"allergens":[],"dietaryTags":["Gluten-Free","High-Protein"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":12.99,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":15,"tags":["Grilled","Quick","Healthy"],"quickTastyDescription":"Juicy grilled chicken marinated in a zesty lemon and herb mix, perfect for a quick and flavorful meal.","detailedCookingInstructions":["In a bowl, whisk together lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, parsley, oregano, salt, and pepper.","Place the chicken breasts in a zip-top bag and pour the marinade over them.
