Discover the perfect combination of pancetta, eggs, and Parmesan for a creamy, delicious meal.","cookingSteps":[{"name":"Boil Water and Cook Spaghetti","description":"Begin by filling a large pot with water. Add a generous amount of salt (about 1 tablespoon for every 4 liters of water) to help flavor the pasta. Bring the water to a rolling boil, then add 200g of spaghetti. Cook according to package instructions until al dente, usually about 8-10 minutes. Make sure to stir occasionally to prevent the pasta from sticking."},{"name":"Prepare Pancetta or Guanciale","description":"While the pasta is cooking, take 100g of pancetta or guanciale and cut it into small pieces (approximately 1cm cubes). Heat a pan over medium heat and add the pancetta. Cook until it becomes crispy and golden brown, which should take about 5-7 minutes. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking."},{"name":"Mix Egg and Cheese","description":"In a mixing bowl, crack 2 large eggs and whisk them together. Add 50g of grated Parmesan cheese and a generous amount of black pepper (roughly 1 teaspoon or more to taste). Whisk until well combined. This mixture will create the creamy sauce for your carbonara."},{"name":"Combine Pasta and Sauce","description":"Once the spaghetti is cooked, reserve about 1 cup of the cooking water, then drain the pasta in a colander. Immediately add the hot spaghetti to the pan with the cooked pancetta (remove from heat to prevent scrambling the eggs). Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the spaghetti. Toss everything together swiftly, adding reserved pasta water a little at a time, until you achieve a creamy consistency."},{"name":"Serve","description":"Transfer the spaghetti carbonara to serving plates or bowls. Top with extra grated Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of black pepper. Serve immediately for the best flavor and texture!"}],"pairings":{"pairings":"For an ideal pairing with Classic Spaghetti Carbonara, consider serving it alongside a light, crisp white wine such as Pinot Grigio or a dry Italian white like Soave. If you prefer red wine, a Chianti can complement the dish well. For a meat option, a simple Caesar salad with grilled chicken can provide a fresh contrast to the richness of the carbonara. Alternatively, garlic bread or a side of sautéed greens, like spinach or broccoli rabe, can balance the flavors beautifully.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the spaghetti carbonara immediately after preparation for the best texture and flavor. Use warm, shallow bowls to maintain the heat of the dish. Garnish with additional grated Parmesan and freshly cracked black pepper for added flavor. For a touch of brightness, consider adding a sprinkling of fresh parsley or a few lemon zest shavings to the top just before serving. This dish is best enjoyed with a fork and spoon to twirl the pasta on the plate.","dietary_considerations":"For a lighter version, consider using whole wheat spaghetti or gluten-free pasta alternatives. To make it vegetarian, replace pancetta or guanciale with sautéed mushrooms or a plant-based bacon alternative, and use nutritional yeast instead of Parmesan for a cheesy flavor without dairy. For a dairy-free option, look for vegan cheese that melts well or use a cashew cream sauce for creaminess. Remember to check that any substitutes fit within your dietary preferences."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I know when my pasta is cooked al dente?","answer":"Al dente means 'to the tooth' in Italian. The pasta should be firm to the bite but not hard. Start tasting it a minute or two before the package cooking time ends."},{"question":"What should I do if my sauce is too thick?","answer":"If the sauce becomes too thick, gradually add a little reserved pasta water until you reach your desired consistency. This will help create a creamy texture."},{"question":"Is it safe to eat raw eggs in carbonara?","answer":"The heat from the hot pasta will cook the eggs quickly, creating a creamy sauce. However, ensure your eggs are fresh and from a reliable source to minimize any health risks."},{"question":"How can I prevent my sauce from scrambling?","answer":"To prevent scrambling, make sure to remove the pan from the heat before adding the egg mixture. Stir quickly to combine while the pasta is still hot."},{"question":"Can I use other types of cheese instead of Parmesan?","answer":"Yes, you can substitute with Pecorino Romano for a sharper flavor. However, keep in mind that it may alter the traditional taste of the dish."},{"question":"What if I don’t have pancetta or guanciale?","answer":"You can substitute with bacon, but keep in mind that it will change the flavor profile slightly. Just ensure it is cooked until crispy."},{"question":"How can I enhance the flavor of my carbonara?","answer":"Using freshly cracked black pepper and high-quality cheese will greatly enhance the flavor. You can also add garlic or onion to the pancetta while cooking for extra depth."},{"question":"What type of pan should I use for cooking the pancetta?","answer":"A non-stick or stainless-steel skillet works well. Ensure it's large enough to hold the spaghetti once it's added."},{"question":"What’s the best way to serve spaghetti carbonara?","answer":"Serve it immediately in warm bowls, topped with extra grated cheese and freshly cracked black pepper for the best experience."},{"question":"Can I make spaghetti carbonara ahead of time?","answer":"It’s best enjoyed fresh, as the sauce can become less creamy when reheated. If you need to prepare it ahead, keep the pasta and sauce separate and combine just before serving."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"spaghetti","advice":"Choose a high-quality durum wheat spaghetti for the best texture and flavor. If you want a gluten-free option, you can substitute it with gluten-free pasta made from rice or corn. Make sure to cook it al dente to avoid a mushy texture."},{"name":"pancetta or guanciale","advice":"Guanciale is the traditional choice for authentic carbonara, offering a rich flavor. If you can't find guanciale, pancetta is a good substitute. In a pinch, you can use bacon, but it will alter the flavor profile. Cut it into small cubes for even cooking."},{"name":"eggs","advice":"Use the freshest eggs possible, as they will contribute to the creaminess of the sauce. If you're concerned about raw eggs, you can use pasteurized eggs. For a richer sauce, consider using just the yolks instead of whole eggs."},{"name":"parmesan cheese","advice":"Always use freshly grated Parmesan for maximum flavor; pre-grated cheese often contains anti-caking agents that affect texture. You can substitute with Pecorino Romano for a sharper taste, but adjust the amount as it can be saltier."},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly cracked black pepper will enhance the dish's flavor more than pre-ground pepper. Adjust the amount based on your spice tolerance; carbonara is meant to have a peppery kick."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Be cautious with salt; the pancetta or guanciale is already salty. Taste your pasta cooking water before adding salt to it, and season to taste, ensuring you don't oversalt the dish."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673acbf794ab1a8249ab70d8","name":"Classic Spaghetti Carbonara","ingredients":[{"name":"spaghetti","quantity":"200g","_id":"673acbfa94ab1a8249ab70e7"},{"name":"pancetta or guanciale","quantity":"100g","_id":"673acbfa94ab1a8249ab70e8"},{"name":"eggs","quantity":"2 large","_id":"673acbfa94ab1a8249ab70e9"},{"name":"parmesan cheese","quantity":"50g, grated","_id":"673acbfa94ab1a8249ab70ea"},{"name":"black pepper","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673acbfa94ab1a8249ab70eb"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673acbfa94ab1a8249ab70ec"}],"calories":600,"allergens":["Gluten","Dairy","Eggs"],"dietaryTags":["High Protein","Quick Meal"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":7.5,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":15,"tags":["Italian","Pasta","Quick"],"quickTastyDescription":"A creamy and savory Italian pasta dish made with eggs, cheese, pancetta, and pepper, perfect for a quick weeknight dinner.","detailedCookingInstructions":["Boil a large pot of salted water and cook the spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente.","While the pasta is cooking, cut the pancetta or guanciale into small pieces and cook in a pan over medium heat until crispy.","In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, and a generous amount of black pepper.","Once the spaghetti is cooked, reserve a cup of pasta water and then drain the pasta.","Add the hot spaghetti to the pan with the pancetta, remove from heat, and quickly mix in the egg and cheese mixture, adding reserved pasta water as needed to create a creamy sauce.","Serve immediately with extra Parmesan and black pepper on top."],"createdByModel":"4o","detailedName":"Classic Spaghetti Carbonara","baseMeal":"Pasta","modifiersForBase":"Creamy and savory sauce with pancetta and cheese","imageUrl":"/images/classic-spaghetti-carbonara-673acbf894ab1a8249ab70dc.webp","image":"673acbf894ab1a8249ab70dc","servings":2,"cuisine":["Italian"],"course":["Main Course","Dinner"],"dateCreated":"2024-11-18T05:09:14.298Z","createdAt":"2024-11-18T05:09:14.300Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-19T05:35:49.060Z","__v":0,"mealUrl":"classic-spaghetti-carbonara-673acbf794ab1a8249ab70d8"},"__v":0}}
