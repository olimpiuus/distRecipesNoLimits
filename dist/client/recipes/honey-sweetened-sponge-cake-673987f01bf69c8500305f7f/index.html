If gluten-free, consider a 1:1 gluten-free flour blend. Sifting the flour before measuring can help prevent clumps and ensure a lighter cake.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">honey</h3><p class="text-gray-700">For a different flavor profile, consider using maple syrup or agave nectar as a substitute, but be aware that this may alter the sweetness level. When using honey, warm it slightly to make it easier to mix, and remember that it can make the cake denser, so balance it with the right amount of flour.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">eggs</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Eggs provide structure and moisture; for a vegan option, you can replace each egg with 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce or 1/4 cup of silken tofu blended until smooth. Make sure to beat the eggs well to incorporate air, which helps the cake rise.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">baking powder</h3><p class="text-gray-700">If you don&#x27;t have baking powder, you can make a substitute using 1/4 tsp baking soda plus 1/2 tsp vinegar or lemon juice for each teaspoon of baking powder needed. Always check the expiration date, as old baking powder may not provide the necessary lift.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">salt</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Salt enhances the sweetness of the cake; however, if you are watching your sodium intake, consider using a low-sodium salt option. For added flavor, you could use sea salt or Himalayan pink salt.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">vanilla extract</h3><p class="text-gray-700">For a more intense flavor, consider using vanilla bean paste or the seeds from a vanilla pod. If you need a substitute, almond extract can provide a different but pleasant flavor, but use it sparingly as it is stronger.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">milk</h3><p class="text-gray-700">You can substitute whole milk with almond milk, soy milk, or oat milk for a dairy-free option. If using a thicker milk (like whole or cream), consider adding a bit of water to achieve the right consistency.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">butter (melted)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">For a non-dairy option, use coconut oil or a vegan butter substitute. If you want a richer flavor, browned butter can add a unique nuttiness, but be careful not to burn it.</p></div></div></section><section class="mb-12 text-justify"><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8 text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500 to-orange-600">Cooking Steps</h2><ul class="space-y-6"><li id="coocking-step-preheat-the-oven" class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-orange-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-800">Step <!-- -->1<!-- -->: <span class="text-orange-600">Preheat the Oven</span></h3><div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).

If gluten-free, consider a 1:1 gluten-free flour blend. Sifting the flour before measuring can help prevent clumps and ensure a lighter cake."},{"name":"honey","advice":"For a different flavor profile, consider using maple syrup or agave nectar as a substitute, but be aware that this may alter the sweetness level.
