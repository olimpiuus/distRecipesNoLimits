If you don&#x27;t have coconut flour, you can substitute it with almond flour but will need to adjust the quantity and add extra eggs for moisture. When measuring coconut flour, spoon it into the measuring cup and level it off to avoid packing it down.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">eggs</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Eggs provide structure and moisture to the cake. If you&#x27;re looking for an egg substitute, you can use flaxseed meal (1 tablespoon flaxseed meal + 2.5 tablespoons water = 1 egg) or applesauce (1/4 cup applesauce = 1 egg). Be mindful that substitutes may alter the texture slightly.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">honey or maple syrup</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Both honey and maple syrup add sweetness and moisture to the cake. If you&#x27;re looking for a lower glycemic index option, consider using agave nectar or stevia (adjust according to taste). For a more intense flavor, try using brown sugar or coconut sugar.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">baking powder</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Baking powder is crucial for leavening. If you’re out of baking powder, you can make your own by combining 1 tsp of baking soda and 1 tsp of cream of tartar. Ensure your baking powder is fresh for optimal rise.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">vanilla extract</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Vanilla extract enhances the flavor profile of the cake. You can substitute it with almond extract for a different flavor, but use it sparingly (1/2 tsp) as it is more potent. For a natural option, scrape the seeds from a vanilla bean pod.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">salt</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Salt balances the sweetness and enhances the overall flavor. If you need a salt substitute, opt for sea salt or Himalayan pink salt. If you’re watching sodium intake, you can reduce the amount or omit it, but this may affect flavor.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">coconut oil (melted)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Coconut oil adds moisture and a subtle coconut flavor. If you don&#x27;t have coconut oil, you can substitute with unsalted butter or another neutral oil like grapeseed or canola oil. Make sure to melt it before using for better incorporation.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">milk (dairy or non-dairy)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Milk adds moisture. You can substitute dairy milk with almond milk, coconut milk, or oat milk for a dairy-free version. If using non-dairy milk, opt for unsweetened varieties to avoid altering the sweetness of the cake.</p></div></div></section><section class="mb-12 text-justify"><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8 text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500 to-orange-600">Cooking Steps</h2><ul class="space-y-6"><li id="coocking-step-preheat-the-oven" class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-orange-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-800">Step <!-- -->1<!-- -->: <span class="text-orange-600">Preheat the oven</span></h3><div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span>Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C).

If you don't have coconut flour, you can substitute it with almond flour but will need to adjust the quantity and add extra eggs for moisture. When measuring coconut flour, spoon it into the measuring cup and level it off to avoid packing it down."},{"name":"eggs","advice":"Eggs provide structure and moisture to the cake.

Be mindful that substitutes may alter the texture slightly."},{"name":"honey or maple syrup","advice":"Both honey and maple syrup add sweetness and moisture to the cake. If you're looking for a lower glycemic index option, consider using agave nectar or stevia (adjust according to taste). For a more intense flavor, try using brown sugar or coconut sugar."},{"name":"baking powder","advice":"Baking powder is crucial for leavening. If you’re out of baking powder, you can make your own by combining 1 tsp of baking soda and 1 tsp of cream of tartar. Ensure your baking powder is fresh for optimal rise."},{"name":"vanilla extract","advice":"Vanilla extract enhances the flavor profile of the cake. You can substitute it with almond extract for a different flavor, but use it sparingly (1/2 tsp) as it is more potent. For a natural option, scrape the seeds from a vanilla bean pod."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Salt balances the sweetness and enhances the overall flavor. If you need a salt substitute, opt for sea salt or Himalayan pink salt. If you’re watching sodium intake, you can reduce the amount or omit it, but this may affect flavor."},{"name":"coconut oil (melted)","advice":"Coconut oil adds moisture and a subtle coconut flavor. If you don't have coconut oil, you can substitute with unsalted butter or another neutral oil like grapeseed or canola oil. Make sure to melt it before using for better incorporation."},{"name":"milk (dairy or non-dairy)","advice":"Milk adds moisture.
