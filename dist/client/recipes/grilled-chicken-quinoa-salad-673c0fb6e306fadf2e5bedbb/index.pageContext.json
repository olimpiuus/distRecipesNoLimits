Clean surfaces and utensils with hot, soapy water after use."},{"question":"What’s the best way to chop vegetables?","answer":"For consistent size, make sure your knife is sharp. Start by cutting off the ends of the cucumber and cherry tomatoes. Slice the cucumber in half lengthwise, then chop into half-moons. Halve the cherry tomatoes for a bite-sized addition to your salad."},{"question":"How do I store leftover salad?","answer":"Store any leftover salad in an airtight container in the fridge. However, keep the dressing separate until you are ready to eat to prevent wilting."},{"question":"Can I use different vegetables in this salad?","answer":"Absolutely! Feel free to add or substitute any vegetables you like, such as bell peppers, avocados, or spinach. Just make sure they are chopped into similar sizes for even distribution."},{"question":"What if I don’t have feta cheese?","answer":"If you don’t have feta cheese, try substituting with goat cheese, mozzarella, or even a vegan cheese alternative.

If you're looking for a substitution, you can use grilled tofu or chickpeas for a vegetarian option."},{"name":"quinoa","advice":"Rinse quinoa under cold water before cooking to remove its natural coating, called saponin, which can taste bitter.
