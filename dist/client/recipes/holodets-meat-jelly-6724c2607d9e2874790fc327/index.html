Ensure it&#x27;s well-trimmed to reduce excess fat. If you need a substitute, use pork butt or even beef chuck for a similar texture and flavor profile.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">beef shank</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Beef shank is ideal for its rich flavor and gelatin content, which contributes to the jellied texture. If unavailable, you can substitute with oxtail or beef brisket, though they may alter the flavor slightly.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">carrots</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Chopped carrots add sweetness and color. For a different flavor, consider parsnips or sweet potatoes. If you&#x27;re looking to enhance their sweetness, roast them before adding to the pot.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">onion</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Quartered onion adds depth to the broth. Use yellow onions for sweetness, or shallots for a milder flavor. If you&#x27;re out of onions, leeks or green onions can be used as alternatives.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">celery stalks</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Chopped celery adds a subtle earthiness to the dish. If you don&#x27;t have celery, you can use fennel or even a small amount of celery salt to impart a similar flavor.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">garlic cloves</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Smashed garlic infuses the broth with aromatic flavor. If you prefer a milder taste, use roasted garlic. For a substitute, garlic powder can be used, though it won&#x27;t provide the same depth.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">bay leaves</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Bay leaves add a fragrant herbal note to the broth. If youâ€™re out, thyme or oregano can work as substitutes, but use less as they are more potent.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">peppercorns</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Whole peppercorns lend a warm spiciness. If you don&#x27;t have them, ground black pepper can be used in a pinch, but add it towards the end of cooking to avoid bitterness.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">salt</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Salt is essential for flavor enhancement.
