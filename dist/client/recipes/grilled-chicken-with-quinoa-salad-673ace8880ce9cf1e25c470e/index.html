For enhanced flavor, marinate the chicken in olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and herbs for at least 30 minutes before grilling. If you don&#x27;t have chicken breast, you can substitute with thighs or even tofu for a vegetarian option.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">quinoa</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Rinse quinoa thoroughly before cooking to remove its natural coating, which can taste bitter. Use vegetable or chicken broth instead of water for cooking to add more flavor. If you don’t have quinoa, you can use couscous or farro as a substitute.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">cucumber</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Choose firm cucumbers and peel them if you prefer a milder taste. For added crunch, consider using Persian cucumbers, which are smaller and seedless. If cucumber is unavailable, zucchini can be a refreshing alternative.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">cherry tomatoes</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Select plump, vibrant cherry tomatoes for sweetness. Roasting them for a few minutes can intensify their flavor, or you can substitute with grape tomatoes or even diced regular tomatoes if needed.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">red onion</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Soaking chopped red onion in cold water for 10-15 minutes can reduce its sharpness, making it milder and sweeter. If red onion is not available, use shallots or green onions as alternatives.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">olive oil</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Use high-quality extra virgin olive oil for the best flavor. You can infuse the oil with herbs or garlic for extra depth. If olive oil is not available, avocado oil or canola oil can be good substitutes.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">lemon juice</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Freshly squeezed lemon juice is preferable for a brighter taste. You can also add some lemon zest for extra citrus flavor. If fresh lemons are unavailable, bottled lemon juice can be used in a pinch, but use less as it can be more concentrated.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">salt</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Use kosher salt for seasoning as it dissolves easily and enhances flavor without over-salting. If you are watching sodium intake, consider using low-sodium salt or seasoning blends.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">pepper</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Freshly ground black pepper provides a more robust flavor than pre-ground. Experiment with different types of peppercorns like white or pink for unique flavor profiles.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">parsley</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Fresh parsley brightens the dish; chop it coarsely for a rustic look or finely for a refined touch.
