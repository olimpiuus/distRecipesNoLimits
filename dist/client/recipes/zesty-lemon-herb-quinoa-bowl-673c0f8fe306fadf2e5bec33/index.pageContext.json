This helps remove the natural coating called saponin, which can make it taste bitter. Shake off excess water before cooking."},{"question":"What is the correct cooking ratio for quinoa?","answer":"The standard ratio is 1 cup of quinoa to 2 cups of liquid (water or broth).

This usually takes about 15 minutes on low heat after boiling."},{"question":"How do I chop cherry tomatoes and cucumber?","answer":"For cherry tomatoes, simply cut them in half.
