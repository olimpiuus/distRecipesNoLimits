Juicy, flavorful, and perfect for any barbecue, these drumsticks will impress your guests!","cookingSteps":[{"name":"Prepare the Marinade","description":"In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of paprika, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Whisk these ingredients together until they form a smooth marinade."},{"name":"Marinate the Chicken","description":"Add the 8 pieces of chicken drumsticks to the bowl with the marinade. Use your hands or tongs to toss the drumsticks until they are thoroughly coated with the marinade. For best results, let them marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or up to 4 hours if you have the time."},{"name":"Preheat the Grill","description":"While the chicken is marinating, preheat your grill to medium-high heat (about 375°F to 450°F or 190°C to 232°C). This ensures the chicken cooks evenly and gets a nice char."},{"name":"Grill the Drumsticks","description":"Once the grill is hot, place the marinated chicken drumsticks directly on the grill grates. Cook for approximately 30 minutes, turning them every 5-7 minutes to ensure even cooking and prevent burning. Use a meat thermometer to check that the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C), which is safe for poultry."},{"name":"Rest and Serve","description":"After cooking, remove the drumsticks from the grill and allow them to rest for about 5 minutes. This helps the juices redistribute throughout the meat, making them more tender and flavorful. Serve with your favorite side dishes."}],"pairings":{"pairings":"For a complete meal, consider serving the grilled chicken drumsticks with a refreshing cucumber and tomato salad, which provides a cooling contrast to the savory spices of the chicken. A side of creamy coleslaw can also enhance the experience. For beverages, pair with a crisp white wine such as Sauvignon Blanc or a light beer like a pilsner. For a non-alcoholic option, a homemade lemonade or iced tea works beautifully.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the grilled chicken drumsticks on a large platter garnished with fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro for a vibrant touch. To add a bit of flair, include lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the chicken. For a casual setting, consider serving the drumsticks with toothpicks or skewers for easy handling, especially at a picnic or barbecue. If desired, drizzle with additional olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt just before serving for added flavor.","dietary_considerations":"This dish is naturally gluten-free and can be made dairy-free. For those on a low-carb diet, it fits well as is. To cater to different dietary preferences, consider marinating some drumsticks with a spicy rub or a herb-based marinade for variety. Additionally, using organic chicken can appeal to those preferring sustainably sourced ingredients."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I know when my grilled chicken drumsticks are done cooking?","answer":"Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature. Chicken is safely cooked when it reaches 165°F (75°C). Insert the thermometer into the thickest part of the drumstick without touching the bone for an accurate reading."},{"question":"What can I use if I don't have garlic powder?","answer":"If you don't have garlic powder, you can substitute with fresh minced garlic (about 1 clove for 1 teaspoon of powder) or omit it altogether. Fresh herbs like rosemary or thyme can also add great flavor."},{"question":"How do I prevent the chicken from sticking to the grill?","answer":"Make sure to preheat your grill and oil the grates lightly before adding the chicken. You can use a paper towel dipped in oil and tongs to wipe the grates. Additionally, avoid moving the chicken too soon; let it sear for a few minutes before flipping."},{"question":"Can I marinate the chicken drumsticks overnight?","answer":"Absolutely! Marinating the drumsticks overnight in the refrigerator will enhance the flavor. Just make sure to cover the bowl or use a zip-top bag to keep the chicken safe from other food."},{"question":"What should I serve with grilled chicken drumsticks?","answer":"Grilled vegetables, a fresh salad, or coleslaw are great side dishes. You can also serve them with rice or potatoes to make a complete meal."},{"question":"How can I tell if my chicken is marinated enough?","answer":"For chicken drumsticks, marinating for at least 30 minutes is ideal, but 2-4 hours will enhance the flavor even more. If you have time, letting them marinate overnight is best!"},{"question":"Is it safe to use the same marinade on cooked chicken?","answer":"No, it's not safe to use the marinade that raw chicken was in unless you boil it first to kill any bacteria. If you want a dipping sauce, set aside some marinade before adding the chicken."},{"question":"How do I turn my grill to medium-high heat?","answer":"For gas grills, preheat with the burners on high for about 10-15 minutes, then adjust to medium-high. For charcoal grills, let the coals burn until they're covered with ash and spread them evenly for medium-high heat."},{"question":"What if I don’t have a grill?","answer":"No worries! You can bake the chicken in the oven at 400°F (200°C) for about 35-40 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C). You can also use a stovetop grill pan for a similar effect."},{"question":"How long should I let the chicken rest after grilling?","answer":"Let the grilled chicken drumsticks rest for about 5 minutes before serving.

If you prefer, you can substitute with chicken thighs or wings.

If you're watching sodium intake, consider using a salt substitute or reducing the amount."},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly ground black pepper is best for a stronger flavor. If you prefer a milder taste, you can use white pepper as a substitute."},{"name":"lemon juice","advice":"Freshly squeezed lemon juice is optimal for brightness. If unavailable, bottled lemon juice works but may lack some freshness. Lime juice is a good alternative for a different citrus flavor."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"674022946da16aa2e977482d","name":"Grilled Chicken Drumsticks","ingredients":[{"name":"chicken drumsticks","quantity":"8 pieces","_id":"674022966da16aa2e977483d"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"674022966da16aa2e977483e"},{"name":"garlic powder","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"674022966da16aa2e977483f"},{"name":"paprika","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"674022966da16aa2e9774840"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"674022966da16aa2e9774841"},{"name":"black pepper","quantity":"1/2 teaspoon","_id":"674022966da16aa2e9774842"},{"name":"lemon juice","quantity":"1 tablespoon","_id":"674022966da16aa2e9774843"}],"calories":250,"allergens":[],"dietaryTags":["High Protein","Gluten Free"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":8.5,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":30,"tags":["Easy","Grilling","Chicken","Barbecue"],"quickTastyDescription":"Juicy and flavorful grilled chicken drumsticks, seasoned to perfection and easy to make!","detailedCookingInstructions":["In a large bowl, combine olive oil, garlic powder, paprika, salt, black pepper, and lemon juice.","Add the chicken drumsticks to the bowl and toss until they are well coated with the marinade.","Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.","Place the drumsticks on the grill and cook for about 30 minutes, turning occasionally, until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C).","Once cooked, remove from grill and let rest for a few minutes before serving."],"createdByModel":"4o","detailedName":"Easy Grilled Chicken Drumsticks","baseMeal":"Chicken Drumsticks","modifiersForBase":"Marinated in olive oil and spices","imageUrl":"/images/grilled-chicken-drumsticks-674022946da16aa2e9774833.webp","image":"674022946da16aa2e9774833","servings":4,"cuisine":["American","Barbecue"],"course":["Main Course"],"dateCreated":"2024-11-22T06:20:06.327Z","createdAt":"2024-11-22T06:20:06.329Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-23T06:06:14.829Z","__v":0,"mealUrl":"grilled-chicken-drumsticks-674022946da16aa2e977482d"},"__v":0}}
