For a touch of elegance, consider adding a drizzle of high-quality olive oil or a few fresh basil leaves on top before serving.

To make the dish lighter, you can use half-and-half instead of heavy cream, or for a vegan alternative, try using coconut cream and a plant-based protein like tofu or chickpeas. Ensure to use vegan Parmesan cheese for a completely dairy-free version."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I know when the pasta is cooked al dente?","answer":"Al dente means 'to the tooth' in Italian, and it refers to pasta that's cooked but still firm when bitten. Check the package instructions for cooking time and taste a piece a minute or two before the time is up; it should be tender but still have a slight bite."},{"question":"What is the best way to dice chicken breast?","answer":"To dice chicken breast, first ensure it's thawed if it was frozen. Place the chicken breast on a cutting board, and using a sharp knife, cut it lengthwise into even strips, then turn the strips and cut across them to create small cubes. Ensure uniform size for even cooking."},{"question":"How can I prevent the garlic from burning when sautéing?","answer":"Garlic can burn quickly and become bitter. To prevent this, add the minced garlic to the skillet after the chicken has cooked for a few minutes, allowing it to sauté for just about 1 minute until fragrant. Keep stirring to avoid direct heat on the garlic."},{"question":"What can I substitute for heavy cream if I want a lighter option?","answer":"You can substitute heavy cream with half-and-half or a mixture of milk and cornstarch (1 cup of milk + 1 tablespoon of cornstarch mixed well). Keep in mind that the sauce might be less rich, but still delicious!"},{"question":"How do I properly season my dish with salt and pepper?","answer":"Start by adding a small amount of salt and pepper while cooking, then taste the dish before serving. You can always add more but can't take it out once it's in! Remember to adjust seasoning at the end as flavors develop during cooking."},{"question":"What should I do if my sauce is too thick?","answer":"If your sauce turns out too thick, simply add a splash of pasta water or additional cream gradually until you reach your desired consistency. This will help loosen it without compromising the flavor."},{"question":"How can I make sure my chicken is cooked through?","answer":"To ensure chicken is fully cooked, use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature; it should reach 165°F (75°C). Alternatively, you can cut a piece in the thickest part—there should be no pink meat inside."},{"question":"What is a good way to garnish my dish?","answer":"Chopped parsley is a great garnish for this dish; it adds color and a fresh flavor. Simply chop it finely and sprinkle it over your plated pasta just before serving."},{"question":"How do I store leftovers properly?","answer":"Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator. They should be consumed within 3-4 days. To reheat, warm gently on the stove with a splash of water or cream to bring back the creaminess."},{"question":"Can I use other types of pasta for this recipe?","answer":"Absolutely! While fettuccine and penne are great choices, you can use any pasta you prefer, such as spaghetti, rigatoni, or even gluten-free pasta. Adjust cooking times based on the pasta type."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"pasta (fettuccine or penne)","advice":"For the best texture, cook the pasta until just al dente, as it will continue to cook slightly when tossed with the sauce. If you don’t have fettuccine or penne, you can substitute with spaghetti, linguine, or macaroni. Whole wheat or gluten-free pasta can also be used for a healthier option."},{"name":"chicken breast (diced)","advice":"Ensure the chicken is uniform in size for even cooking. For added flavor, marinate the chicken in olive oil, lemon juice, and herbs before cooking. If you prefer, you can substitute chicken thighs for a more tender and flavorful option."},{"name":"garlic (minced)","advice":"Fresh garlic provides the best flavor, but you can substitute with jarred minced garlic in a pinch (1 teaspoon jarred = 1 clove fresh). To mellow the flavor, sauté the garlic for a shorter time or add it at the end of cooking."},{"name":"heavy cream","advice":"For a lighter option, you can substitute half-and-half or whole milk, but the sauce will be less creamy. If you want to make it dairy-free, use coconut cream or a cashew cream."},{"name":"parmesan cheese (grated)","advice":"Freshly grated Parmesan will yield the best flavor and texture. If you don’t have Parmesan, Pecorino Romano or Grana Padano can be used as substitutes. Nutritional yeast can provide a cheesy flavor for a vegan option."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Extra virgin olive oil is best for flavor. If you need a higher smoke point, you can use canola or grapeseed oil. You can also add a bit of butter for richness while cooking the chicken."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Always season as you go! Adjust the salt at the end to ensure the dish isn’t over-seasoned. For a low-sodium option, use herbs and spices to enhance flavor without adding salt."},{"name":"pepper","advice":"Freshly ground black pepper has the best flavor. You can also experiment with white or red pepper for different heat levels. If you prefer a milder dish, reduce the amount or omit."},{"name":"parsley (chopped, for garnish)","advice":"Fresh parsley adds color and freshness to the dish.
