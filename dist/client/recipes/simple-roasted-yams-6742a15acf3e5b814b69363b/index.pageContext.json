If yams are not available, sweet potatoes can be a good substitute, though they may be slightly sweeter. To enhance flavor, consider soaking the cut yams in cold water for 30 minutes to remove excess starch, which can lead to a creamier texture when cooked."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Extra virgin olive oil is best for roasting due to its rich flavor. If you prefer a different taste, avocado oil or melted coconut oil can be used as substitutes. For added flavor, consider infusing the oil with garlic or herbs before tossing it with the yams."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Use kosher salt for a coarser crunch, or sea salt for a more delicate flavor. If you're watching your sodium intake, consider using a salt substitute or reducing the amount. You can also enhance the saltiness by using flavored salts (like garlic salt) for an extra kick."},{"name":"pepper","advice":"Freshly ground black pepper is ideal for maximum flavor. If you want a bit of heat, consider using cayenne pepper or crushed red pepper flakes instead. For a milder flavor, use white pepper, which has a different, less pungent profile."},{"name":"ground cinnamon","advice":"Use fresh ground cinnamon for the best flavor; it loses potency over time. If you want to spice things up, consider adding a pinch of nutmeg or allspice to complement the cinnamon. For an alternative, try using chai spice mix for a more complex flavor profile."}],"mealId":{"_id":"6742a15acf3e5b814b69363b","name":"Simple Roasted Yams","ingredients":[{"name":"yams","quantity":"2 large","_id":"6742a15ccf3e5b814b693644"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"6742a15ccf3e5b814b693645"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"6742a15ccf3e5b814b693646"},{"name":"pepper","quantity":"1/2 teaspoon","_id":"6742a15ccf3e5b814b693647"},{"name":"ground cinnamon","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"6742a15ccf3e5b814b693648"}],"calories":180,"allergens":[],"dietaryTags":["Vegan","Gluten-Free"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":5,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":30,"tags":["easy","quick","healthy","vegan"],"quickTastyDescription":"Deliciously sweet and caramelized yams, roasted to perfection with minimal effort!","detailedCookingInstructions":["Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).","Peel the yams and cut them into bite-sized cubes.","In a large bowl, toss the yam cubes with olive oil, salt, pepper, and cinnamon until evenly coated.","Spread the yams in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.","Roast in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until tender and slightly caramelized, stirring halfway through cooking."],"createdByModel":"4o","baseMeal":"Roasted Vegetables","modifiersForBase":"Sweet and spiced","imageUrl":"/images/simple-roasted-yams-6742a15bcf3e5b814b69363f.webp","image":"6742a15bcf3e5b814b69363f","servings":4,"cuisine":["American"],"course":["Side Dish"],"occasions":["Everyday","Holiday","Potluck"],"mealUrl":"simple-roasted-yams-6742a15acf3e5b814b69363b","SEOLongkeywords":["easy roasted yams","simple yam recipe","quick healthy side dish","vegan roasted vegetables"],"dateCreated":"2024-11-24T03:45:32.820Z","createdAt":"2024-11-24T03:45:32.824Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-24T03:45:32.824Z","__v":0},"createdAt":"2024-11-24T03:45:46.568Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-24T03:45:46.568Z","__v":0}}
