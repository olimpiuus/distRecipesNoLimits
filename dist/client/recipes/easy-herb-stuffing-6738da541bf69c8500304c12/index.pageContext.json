It also pairs beautifully with a rich vegetable dish, such as roasted Brussels sprouts or honey-glazed carrots.

You can also use leftover bread that’s a bit stale, as it absorbs the broth better."},{"question":"How do I chop vegetables properly?","answer":"To chop vegetables, use a sharp knife and a cutting board. For onions and celery, slice them into uniform pieces to ensure even cooking. Start by cutting off the ends, peel the onion, and slice it in half. Place the flat side down and slice vertically, then chop horizontally."},{"question":"What if I don’t have chicken or vegetable broth?","answer":"If you don’t have broth, you can use water, but the flavor won't be as rich. You could also use a bouillon cube dissolved in water to mimic broth."},{"question":"How do I know when my stuffing is done baking?","answer":"Your stuffing is done when the top is golden brown and crispy. You can also check by inserting a fork into the middle; it should feel hot and the bread should be moist but not soggy."},{"question":"Can I make stuffing ahead of time?","answer":"Yes! You can prepare the stuffing mixture a day in advance, cover it, and refrigerate. On the day you plan to serve it, bake it as directed. You may need to add a few extra minutes to the baking time."},{"question":"What can I do to make my stuffing more flavorful?","answer":"You can add additional herbs like rosemary or oregano, or mix in sautéed mushrooms, garlic, or nuts for texture. Dried fruits like cranberries or apples can add sweetness."},{"question":"Is it safe to eat the stuffing if it was cooked inside a turkey?","answer":"Yes, but ensure it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C) to kill any harmful bacteria. If you’re unsure, it’s safer to cook stuffing separately."},{"question":"How do I safely handle a hot baking dish?","answer":"Always use oven mitts when handling hot dishes. Place the hot dish on a stable surface and let it cool slightly before serving to avoid burns."},{"question":"What’s the best way to store leftover stuffing?","answer":"Store leftover stuffing in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. You can reheat it in the oven or microwave; just add a splash of broth or water to keep it moist."},{"question":"Can I freeze stuffing?","answer":"Yes, you can freeze stuffing! Allow it to cool completely, then transfer it to a freezer-safe container or bag. It can be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before reheating."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"cubed bread","advice":"Use a day-old bread for better texture; it absorbs the broth without becoming mushy. If you don’t have bread, you can substitute with store-bought stuffing mix or gluten-free bread if needed."},{"name":"butter","advice":"For a richer flavor, consider using unsalted butter so you can control the saltiness. You can also substitute with olive oil or vegan butter for a dairy-free option."},{"name":"onion, chopped","advice":"Yellow or white onions work best for sweetness, but shallots or even leeks can be used for a milder taste.

Always sauté to soften before adding to the stuffing."},{"name":"chicken or vegetable broth","advice":"Homemade broth enhances flavor; however, low-sodium versions are great for controlling salt levels. You can also use water in a pinch, but add herbs for flavor."},{"name":"dried sage","advice":"Sage is essential for a classic stuffing flavor; fresh sage can be substituted at a ratio of 3:1 (3 teaspoons fresh for 1 teaspoon dried).
