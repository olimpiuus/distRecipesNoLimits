The powdered sugar gives the Puppy Chow its signature sweet coating."},{"name":"Cool and Serve","description":"Spread the Puppy Chow mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper to cool for a few minutes.

For a more wholesome version, consider using a whole grain Chex."},{"name":"peanut butter","advice":"If you have a nut allergy, you can substitute peanut butter with sunbutter (sunflower seed butter) or soy nut butter.

If you’re out of vanilla extract, you can substitute it with almond extract for a different twist, but use it sparingly as it has a stronger flavor."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Salt enhances the sweetness of the Puppy Chow, so don't skip it!
