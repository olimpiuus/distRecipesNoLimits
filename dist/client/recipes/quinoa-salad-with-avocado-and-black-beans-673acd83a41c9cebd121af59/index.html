For a nuttier flavor, toast the rinsed quinoa in a dry pan for a few minutes before adding water. If you don&#x27;t have quinoa, consider substituting with couscous, bulgur, or farro, but adjust the cooking times accordingly.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">black beans (canned, drained and rinsed)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Using canned black beans is convenient, but ensure to rinse them well to reduce sodium content and remove any canning liquid. If you prefer, you can cook dried black beans from scratch, which enhances the flavor. Substitute with other beans like kidney beans or pinto beans if needed.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">avocado</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Choose ripe avocados that yield slightly to gentle pressure. If your avocado is hard, you can speed up the ripening process by placing it in a paper bag with a banana. To prevent browning after cutting, drizzle with lime juice. If you don&#x27;t have an avocado, silken tofu can be used for creaminess, or you can add a dollop of Greek yogurt.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">cherry tomatoes</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Select firm, vibrant tomatoes for the best flavor. Halve them to enhance their sweetness and let their juices mix with the other ingredients. If cherry tomatoes are not available, you can use grape tomatoes or regular tomatoes diced into small pieces.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">red onion</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Soak chopped red onion in cold water for 10-15 minutes to mellow its sharp flavor, then drain before adding to the salad. If you prefer a milder taste, consider using green onions or sweet onion varieties like Vidalia.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">cilantro (fresh, chopped)</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Fresh cilantro adds a bright flavor, but if you&#x27;re not a fan, try substituting with parsley for a similar texture without the distinct taste. For a flavor boost, consider adding lime zest along with the cilantro.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">lime juice</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Freshly squeezed lime juice is best for optimal flavor. If you don&#x27;t have limes, lemon juice can be used as a substitute. For added depth, consider mixing in a splash of apple cider vinegar.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">olive oil</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Use extra virgin olive oil for the best flavor. If you&#x27;re looking for a different taste, try avocado oil or a flavored olive oil, such as garlic or herb-infused oils.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">salt</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Start with a small amount and adjust to taste, especially since canned beans can contain salt. Try using sea salt or kosher salt for better texture.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">pepper</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Freshly cracked black pepper is preferable for its robust flavor.
