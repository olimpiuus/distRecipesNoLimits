Perfect for meal prep, a quick lunch, or a healthy side dish!","cookingSteps":[{"name":"Rinse the Quinoa","description":"Begin by rinsing 1 cup of quinoa under cold water. This step is essential as it removes the natural coating called saponin, which can give quinoa a bitter taste. Use a fine-mesh strainer for best results."},{"name":"Cook the Quinoa","description":"In a medium-sized pot, combine the rinsed quinoa with 2 cups of water. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the water is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy. Make sure to keep the lid on to trap the steam."},{"name":"Cool the Quinoa","description":"After cooking, remove the pot from heat and let it sit covered for an additional 5 minutes. This helps the quinoa finish cooking by steaming in its own heat. Fluff the quinoa with a fork and allow it to cool slightly before adding it to the salad."},{"name":"Prepare the Salad Ingredients","description":"While the quinoa is cooling, prepare your salad ingredients. Dice 1 avocado, halve 1 cup of cherry tomatoes, finely chop 1/4 cup of red onion, and chop 1/4 cup of fresh cilantro. Keep your knife skills sharp as this not only makes prep easier but also enhances the presentation of your salad."},{"name":"Combine the Salad","description":"In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooled quinoa, drained and rinsed black beans, diced avocado, halved cherry tomatoes, finely chopped red onion, and fresh cilantro. Gently toss the ingredients to mix, being careful not to mash the avocado."},{"name":"Make the Dressing","description":"In a small bowl, whisk together 2 tablespoons of lime juice, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, salt, and pepper to taste. This dressing is simple yet flavorful, enhancing the freshness of the salad."},{"name":"Dress the Salad","description":"Pour the dressing over the salad mixture and toss gently to combine all ingredients. Ensure that the dressing is well distributed for maximum flavor."},{"name":"Serve or Chill","description":"You can serve the salad immediately for a fresh, vibrant dish or refrigerate it for about 30 minutes.

For a vegetarian option, consider serving it alongside roasted vegetables or a side of tzatziki. As for beverages, a chilled Sauvignon Blanc or a light-bodied beer, such as a pilsner, complements the fresh flavors of the salad. For a non-alcoholic option, try sparkling water with a splash of lime juice.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the quinoa salad in a large, shallow bowl to showcase its vibrant colors. Garnish with extra cilantro and lime wedges for added freshness. For a picnic or outdoor gathering, consider packing individual portions in mason jars for a visually appealing presentation. This dish is also excellent as a filling for lettuce wraps or as a topping for nachos, providing versatility in serving.","dietary_considerations":"This quinoa salad is naturally gluten-free and vegan, making it suitable for a variety of dietary preferences.

This helps remove the natural coating called saponin, which can taste bitter."},{"question":"What is the correct water-to-quinoa ratio?","answer":"The standard ratio for cooking quinoa is 2 cups of water for every 1 cup of quinoa.

You should see tiny white spirals or tails coming from each grain. It typically takes about 15 minutes."},{"question":"What’s the best way to chop an avocado?","answer":"To chop an avocado, first slice it in half lengthwise around the pit. Twist the halves to separate them. Use a spoon to scoop out the flesh, then cut it into cubes by slicing it while still in the skin, and use the spoon to scoop out the pieces."},{"question":"How can I ensure my salad is well-seasoned?","answer":"Start by adding a little salt and pepper, then taste as you go. You can always add more seasoning, but you can't take it away. A good rule of thumb is to start with a pinch of salt and a dash of pepper, then adjust to your preference."},{"question":"Is it safe to eat raw red onion in salads?","answer":"Yes, it's perfectly safe to eat raw red onion in salads.

The flavors typically improve after a day, but the avocado may brown slightly."},{"question":"What can I substitute for lime juice?","answer":"If you don't have lime juice, you can use lemon juice or apple cider vinegar as a substitute. Both will give your salad a nice acidity."},{"question":"Can I add other ingredients to this salad?","answer":"Absolutely! Feel free to customize your salad by adding ingredients like corn, bell peppers, or diced cucumbers. Just keep the proportions balanced."},{"question":"What kitchen tools do I need to make this salad?","answer":"You'll need a pot for cooking quinoa, a strainer for rinsing, a cutting board, a knife, and mixing bowls. A whisk is handy for mixing the dressing."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"quinoa","advice":"Rinse the quinoa thoroughly before cooking to remove its natural coating, called saponin, which can give a bitter taste. For a nuttier flavor, toast the rinsed quinoa in a dry pan for a few minutes before adding water. If you don't have quinoa, consider substituting with couscous, bulgur, or farro, but adjust the cooking times accordingly."},{"name":"black beans (canned, drained and rinsed)","advice":"Using canned black beans is convenient, but ensure to rinse them well to reduce sodium content and remove any canning liquid. If you prefer, you can cook dried black beans from scratch, which enhances the flavor. Substitute with other beans like kidney beans or pinto beans if needed."},{"name":"avocado","advice":"Choose ripe avocados that yield slightly to gentle pressure. If your avocado is hard, you can speed up the ripening process by placing it in a paper bag with a banana. To prevent browning after cutting, drizzle with lime juice. If you don't have an avocado, silken tofu can be used for creaminess, or you can add a dollop of Greek yogurt."},{"name":"cherry tomatoes","advice":"Select firm, vibrant tomatoes for the best flavor. Halve them to enhance their sweetness and let their juices mix with the other ingredients. If cherry tomatoes are not available, you can use grape tomatoes or regular tomatoes diced into small pieces."},{"name":"red onion","advice":"Soak chopped red onion in cold water for 10-15 minutes to mellow its sharp flavor, then drain before adding to the salad. If you prefer a milder taste, consider using green onions or sweet onion varieties like Vidalia."},{"name":"cilantro (fresh, chopped)","advice":"Fresh cilantro adds a bright flavor, but if you're not a fan, try substituting with parsley for a similar texture without the distinct taste. For a flavor boost, consider adding lime zest along with the cilantro."},{"name":"lime juice","advice":"Freshly squeezed lime juice is best for optimal flavor. If you don't have limes, lemon juice can be used as a substitute. For added depth, consider mixing in a splash of apple cider vinegar."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Use extra virgin olive oil for the best flavor. If you're looking for a different taste, try avocado oil or a flavored olive oil, such as garlic or herb-infused oils."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Start with a small amount and adjust to taste, especially since canned beans can contain salt. Try using sea salt or kosher salt for better texture."},{"name":"pepper","advice":"Freshly cracked black pepper is preferable for its robust flavor. You can also experiment with different types of pepper like cayenne or smoked paprika for a little heat or smokiness."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673acd83a41c9cebd121af59","name":"Quinoa Salad with Avocado and Black Beans","ingredients":[{"name":"quinoa","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673acd87a41c9cebd121af6e"},{"name":"black beans (canned, drained and rinsed)","quantity":"1 can","_id":"673acd87a41c9cebd121af6f"},{"name":"avocado","quantity":"1","_id":"673acd87a41c9cebd121af70"},{"name":"cherry tomatoes","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673acd87a41c9cebd121af71"},{"name":"red onion","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"673acd87a41c9cebd121af72"},{"name":"cilantro (fresh, chopped)","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"673acd87a41c9cebd121af73"},{"name":"lime juice","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"673acd87a41c9cebd121af74"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"1 tablespoon","_id":"673acd87a41c9cebd121af75"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673acd87a41c9cebd121af76"},{"name":"pepper","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673acd87a41c9cebd121af77"}],"calories":350,"allergens":[],"dietaryTags":["Vegetarian","Gluten-Free","High-Protein"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":12,"preparationTime":10,"cookingTime":15,"tags":["Salad","Healthy","Quick Meal"],"quickTastyDescription":"A refreshing and nutritious salad packed with protein and healthy fats, perfect for a quick meal!","detailedCookingInstructions":["Rinse the quinoa under cold water until water runs clear.","In a pot, combine 1 cup of quinoa with 2 cups of water.
