If you&#x27;re short on time, you can use chicken thighs as a substitute, but adjust cooking time accordingly as they may take a bit longer to cook.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">olive oil</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Extra virgin olive oil adds a rich flavor, but you can substitute it with melted coconut oil or avocado oil if you prefer a different taste or need a higher smoke point.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">garlic powder</h3><p class="text-gray-700">If you don&#x27;t have garlic powder, you can substitute with minced fresh garlic (about 2-3 cloves) for a more robust flavor. Alternatively, granulated garlic works as well.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">paprika</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Regular paprika adds color and mild flavor. For a smokier taste, use smoked paprika. If you want a kick, opt for hot paprika or cayenne pepper.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">salt</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Kosher salt is preferred for seasoning as it dissolves easily and enhances flavors. If using table salt, consider reducing the quantity slightly, as it can be saltier by volume.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">black pepper</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Freshly cracked black pepper offers the best flavor. If you prefer a milder taste, use white pepper or omit it altogether.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">dried oregano</h3><p class="text-gray-700">Dried oregano is great for this recipe, but if you have fresh oregano on hand, use about three times the amount (3 teaspoons) for a fresher taste. You can also substitute it with Italian seasoning if you want a mix of herbs.</p></div></div></section><section class="mb-12 text-justify"><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8 text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500 to-orange-600">Cooking Steps</h2><ul class="space-y-6"><li id="coocking-step-preheat-the-oven" class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-orange-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-800">Step <!-- -->1<!-- -->: <span class="text-orange-600">Preheat the Oven</span></h3><div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span>Begin by preheating your oven to 425°F (220°C).

You can substitute spices based on what you have. For example, if you don&#x27;t have paprika, try using chili powder or cumin. Just remember to adjust the quantities to your taste.</p></div><div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-gray-400 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-700">How can I tell when the chicken is done cooking?</h3><p class="text-gray-700">The best way to check is by using a meat thermometer. Insert it into the thickest part of the drumstick; it should read 165°F (74°C) for safe consumption.
