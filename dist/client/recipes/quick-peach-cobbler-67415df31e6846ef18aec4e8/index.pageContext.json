This includes measuring cups, a mixing bowl, and a baking dish. Preheating the oven to 350°F (175°C) is also important to ensure your cobbler bakes evenly."},{"question":"How do I measure ingredients accurately?","answer":"Use dry measuring cups for dry ingredients like flour and sugar. Fill the cup to overflowing, then level it off with a straight edge. For liquids like milk, use a liquid measuring cup and check the measurement at eye level."},{"question":"What is the purpose of baking powder in the recipe?","answer":"Baking powder is a leavening agent that helps the batter rise as it bakes, resulting in a light and fluffy texture. Be sure to check its expiration date for best results."},{"question":"Can I use fresh peaches instead of canned?","answer":"Yes, you can use fresh peaches! Peel and slice about 4 cups of fresh peaches, and you may want to add a bit more sugar to balance the tartness."},{"question":"How do I know when my peach cobbler is done?","answer":"The cobbler is done when the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the batter comes out clean. If the top is browning too fast, you can cover it loosely with aluminum foil."},{"question":"What should I do if I don’t have all-purpose flour?","answer":"If you don’t have all-purpose flour, you can use a gluten-free flour blend or a different type of flour, like whole wheat flour.

What should I be cautious about?","answer":"Always use oven mitts when handling hot dishes. Ensure that the oven is preheated before placing your cobbler inside, and keep a close eye on it to prevent burning."},{"question":"How can I make my cobbler even sweeter?","answer":"If you prefer a sweeter cobbler, you can increase the sugar slightly or add a sprinkle of cinnamon for added flavor. Just be careful not to overdo it!"}],"ingredients":[{"name":"canned peaches","advice":"Canned peaches are convenient and already sweetened. For a fresher taste, consider using fresh peaches; peel and slice them, then toss with a little sugar to mimic the syrup. If you want a more intense flavor, use frozen peaches, thaw and drain them before use."},{"name":"sugar","advice":"You can adjust the amount of sugar based on your sweetness preference or substitute with brown sugar for a deeper flavor. For a healthier option, consider using honey or maple syrup, but reduce the liquid in the recipe slightly to account for the additional moisture."},{"name":"all-purpose flour","advice":"This is the standard flour for baking, but you can substitute with whole wheat flour for a nuttier flavor and added fiber. Alternatively, gluten-free all-purpose flour works well if you're gluten intolerant; make sure it contains a binding agent like xanthan gum."},{"name":"baking powder","advice":"Ensure your baking powder is fresh for the best rise; if it's past its expiration date, it won't work effectively. If you don't have baking powder, you can make a substitute with 1/4 tsp baking soda mixed with 1/2 tsp vinegar or lemon juice."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Salt enhances the sweetness of desserts, so don’t skip it. If you’re watching your sodium intake, you can reduce it to a pinch. Alternatively, use sea salt for a more complex flavor."},{"name":"milk","advice":"You can use any milk (whole, skim, or non-dairy alternatives like almond or oat milk) in this recipe. If you're using a non-dairy milk, choose one that's unsweetened to keep the overall sweetness balanced."},{"name":"butter","advice":"Melted butter adds richness; you can substitute with coconut oil or a vegan butter alternative for a dairy-free option.
