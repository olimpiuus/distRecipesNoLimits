Perfect for Thanksgiving or any autumn celebration!","cookingSteps":[{"name":"Preheat the Oven","description":"Begin by preheating your oven to 425°F (220°C). This initial high temperature helps set the crust and gives the pie a nice rise."},{"name":"Mix the Filling","description":"In a large bowl, combine 1 can (15 oz) of pumpkin puree, 3/4 cup of sugar, and 3 large eggs. Add 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of ground nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Mix thoroughly until everything is well combined."},{"name":"Add Evaporated Milk","description":"Slowly stir in 1 can (12 oz) of evaporated milk to the pumpkin mixture. Mix until the filling is smooth and creamy, ensuring that there are no lumps."},{"name":"Prepare the Pie Crust","description":"Take your 9-inch pie crust (store-bought or homemade) and place it in a pie dish. If using a refrigerated crust, follow the package instructions for unrolling and fitting it into the dish."},{"name":"Pour the Filling","description":"Carefully pour the pumpkin mixture into the prepared pie crust, using a spatula to smooth the top if necessary."},{"name":"Bake the Pie","description":"Bake the pie in the preheated oven at 425°F (220°C) for 15 minutes. Then, reduce the temperature to 350°F (175°C) and continue baking for an additional 35-40 minutes. Check for doneness by inserting a knife into the center; it should come out clean."},{"name":"Cool the Pie","description":"Once baked, remove the pie from the oven and allow it to cool at room temperature for at least 2 hours. This cooling time allows the filling to set properly."},{"name":"Serve with Whipped Cream","description":"Before serving, top each slice of pie with a generous dollop of whipped cream for added flavor and presentation."}],"pairings":{"pairings":"For an ideal pairing with Pumpkin Pie, consider serving it alongside a rich scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of freshly whipped cream for added creaminess. Complementary beverages include a spiced chai latte or a warm glass of apple cider. For a wine pairing, a late harvest Riesling or a light-bodied dessert wine will enhance the sweet and spiced notes of the pie. A splash of bourbon or dark rum in the whipped cream can add an extra layer of flavor.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the Pumpkin Pie chilled or at room temperature, ideally after allowing it to cool for at least 2 hours post-baking. Slice the pie into wedges and serve on decorative plates, garnished with a sprinkle of ground cinnamon or nutmeg for an elegant touch. Consider adding a small sprig of mint on the side for color and freshness. If you're hosting a gathering, serve slices on a large platter with individual bowls of whipped cream, allowing guests to add as much or as little as they like.","dietary_considerations":"For a gluten-free option, use a gluten-free pie crust or make a crustless version by baking the filling directly in a greased pie dish. For a dairy-free option, substitute the evaporated milk with coconut milk or almond milk and use a non-dairy whipped cream alternative. Those looking for a lower sugar option can use a sugar alternative suitable for baking, such as monk fruit sweetener or erythritol."},"faqs":[{"question":"What is pumpkin puree, and can I make it myself?","answer":"Pumpkin puree is made from cooked and pureed pumpkin. You can make it by roasting a fresh pumpkin, scooping out the flesh, and blending it until smooth. However, for beginners, using canned pumpkin puree is convenient and saves time."},{"question":"How do I properly measure dry ingredients like sugar and spices?","answer":"Use dry measuring cups for dry ingredients. Spoon the ingredient into the cup, then level it off with a straight edge (like a knife) for accuracy. This ensures you don’t add too much or too little."},{"question":"What do I do if my pie crust cracks or tears?","answer":"If your pie crust cracks, you can patch it with a small piece of dough. Simply wet the edges slightly with water and press the patch into place. If you’re using a refrigerated crust, handle it gently to avoid cracking."},{"question":"How do I know when my pumpkin pie is done baking?","answer":"The pie is done when the center is set and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. It should have a slight jiggle, but not be liquidy. If the crust edges brown too quickly, cover them with foil."},{"question":"What’s the easiest way to cool a pie?","answer":"Place the pie on a wire rack or a cooling sheet to allow air to circulate around it. This prevents moisture from making the crust soggy. Avoid placing it in the fridge until it's at room temperature to prevent condensation."},{"question":"Can I use fresh spices instead of ground spices?","answer":"Yes! Fresh spices can enhance flavor. For instance, use freshly grated nutmeg instead of ground nutmeg. Use about half the amount when substituting fresh for dried spices."},{"question":"How do I safely handle raw eggs?","answer":"Always wash your hands before and after handling raw eggs. Ensure that your mixing bowls and utensils are clean. If you're concerned about salmonella, you can use pasteurized eggs."},{"question":"What type of whipped cream should I use?","answer":"You can use store-bought whipped cream or make your own by whipping heavy cream with a little sugar and vanilla extract until soft peaks form. Homemade is fresh and delicious!"},{"question":"How do I store leftover pumpkin pie?","answer":"Cover the pie with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and store it in the refrigerator. It’s best enjoyed within 3-4 days."},{"question":"What if I don’t have evaporated milk?","answer":"You can substitute evaporated milk with an equal amount of whole milk or cream mixed with a little cornstarch to thicken it slightly, or use a mixture of 1 cup of milk and 2 tablespoons of butter."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"pumpkin puree","advice":"Use canned pumpkin puree for convenience, but you can also make your own by roasting a sugar pumpkin until tender and blending it. If you want to reduce sweetness, choose a lower-sugar variety or blend with other vegetables like sweet potatoes."},{"name":"sugar","advice":"You can substitute white granulated sugar with brown sugar for a deeper flavor, or use coconut sugar for a healthier option. If you want to reduce sugar, consider using a sugar substitute like monk fruit or erythritol, but check the conversion ratios."},{"name":"eggs","advice":"Eggs provide structure and richness to the pie. If you need a vegan option, use flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 2.5 tablespoons water per egg) or silken tofu blended until smooth as a substitute."},{"name":"ground cinnamon","advice":"Cinnamon enhances warmth and flavor in the pie. For a more complex taste, try using Ceylon cinnamon instead of the more common Cassia cinnamon. You can also add a pinch of allspice or cardamom for additional depth."},{"name":"ground nutmeg","advice":"Freshly grated nutmeg has a much stronger flavor than pre-ground. If you have whole nutmeg, consider grating it just before adding to the mixture. If you don’t have nutmeg, you can substitute it with a bit more cinnamon."},{"name":"ground ginger","advice":"Fresh ginger can be used instead of ground ginger. Use about 1 tablespoon of freshly grated ginger for a stronger flavor. If you don’t have ginger, you can omit it or use a dash of ground cloves for a different spice note."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Salt enhances the sweetness of the pie. If you're watching sodium intake, reduce the amount or use a low-sodium salt. Alternatively, a pinch of sea salt can provide a more complex flavor."},{"name":"evaporated milk","advice":"For a dairy-free alternative, use coconut milk or almond milk. If using coconut milk, it may impart a subtle coconut flavor, which can complement the pumpkin. Ensure to choose unsweetened versions."},{"name":"pie crust","advice":"If you prefer a homemade crust, use a mixture of flour, butter, and a pinch of salt. For a gluten-free option, use almond or gluten-free flour blends. Pre-baking the crust for 10-15 minutes can help keep it from getting soggy."},{"name":"whipped cream","advice":"For a healthier option, you can use whipped coconut cream. To enhance flavor, add a little vanilla extract or a sprinkle of cinnamon to your whipped cream before serving."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"_id":"67416f64e52d259d67972a60","name":"Pumpkin Pie with Whipped Cream","ingredients":[{"name":"pumpkin puree","quantity":"1 can (15 oz)","_id":"67416f6ae52d259d67972a6b"},{"name":"sugar","quantity":"3/4 cup","_id":"67416f6ae52d259d67972a6c"},{"name":"eggs","quantity":"3 large","_id":"67416f6ae52d259d67972a6d"},{"name":"ground cinnamon","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"67416f6ae52d259d67972a6e"},{"name":"ground nutmeg","quantity":"1/2 teaspoon","_id":"67416f6ae52d259d67972a6f"},{"name":"ground ginger","quantity":"1/2 teaspoon","_id":"67416f6ae52d259d67972a70"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"1/2 teaspoon","_id":"67416f6ae52d259d67972a71"},{"name":"evaporated milk","quantity":"1 can (12 oz)","_id":"67416f6ae52d259d67972a72"},{"name":"pie crust","quantity":"1 (9-inch) refrigerated or homemade","_id":"67416f6ae52d259d67972a73"},{"name":"whipped cream","quantity":"to serve","_id":"67416f6ae52d259d67972a74"}],"calories":320,"allergens":["Eggs","Dairy"],"dietaryTags":["Vegetarian","Nut-free"],"difficultyPercent":20,"price":10,"preparationTime":15,"cookingTime":60,"tags":["Dessert","Fall","Easy","Classic"],"quickTastyDescription":"A classic, creamy pumpkin pie topped with fluffy whipped cream, perfect for fall gatherings!","detailedCookingInstructions":["Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).","In a large bowl, mix together the pumpkin puree, sugar, eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and salt until well combined.","Gradually stir in the evaporated milk until the mixture is smooth.","Pour the pumpkin mixture into the pie crust.","Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.
