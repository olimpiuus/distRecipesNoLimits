Perfect for summer barbecues or quick weeknight dinners, this dish is flavorful and healthy!","cookingSteps":[{"name":"Prepare the Marinade","description":"In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine 1/4 cup of lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 2 minced garlic cloves, 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley, 1 teaspoon of dried oregano, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper. Whisk the ingredients together until well blended. This marinade not only adds flavor but also helps tenderize the chicken."},{"name":"Marinate the Chicken","description":"Take 4 pieces of chicken breasts and place them in a ziplock bag or a shallow dish. Pour the prepared marinade over the chicken, ensuring each piece is well-coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish with plastic wrap. Let the chicken marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours for enhanced flavor. **Tip:** Marinating for longer allows deeper flavor penetration; however, avoid marinating for more than 2 hours to prevent the chicken from becoming mushy."},{"name":"Preheat the Grill","description":"While the chicken is marinating, preheat your grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. This is crucial for achieving those beautiful grill marks and ensuring even cooking. **Note:** If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash."},{"name":"Grill the Chicken","description":"Once the grill is hot, carefully remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinade. Place the chicken breasts on the grill and cook for about 6-7 minutes on one side. Flip the chicken and continue grilling for another 6-7 minutes. Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature, which should reach 165°F (75°C) for safe consumption."},{"name":"Rest and Serve","description":"After grilling, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for about 5 minutes. This resting period allows the juices to redistribute, keeping the chicken moist. After resting, slice the chicken and serve it with your favorite sides. **Tip:** Pair it with a fresh salad or grilled vegetables for a light meal."}],"pairings":{"pairings":"For a perfect meal, serve the Lemon Herb Grilled Chicken with a light and refreshing side salad, such as a cucumber and tomato salad tossed with a simple vinaigrette. Grilled vegetables like zucchini, bell peppers, and asparagus also complement the chicken beautifully. For beverages, consider pairing with a chilled Sauvignon Blanc or a light, citrusy beer to enhance the lemony flavors.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the grilled chicken on a large platter garnished with extra chopped parsley and lemon wedges for a vibrant presentation. Accompany the main dish with a side of herbed quinoa or couscous to soak up the marinade flavors. For a casual setting, consider serving the chicken in sandwiches with fresh greens and a smear of pesto for added flavor.","dietary_considerations":"This dish is naturally gluten-free and can be made dairy-free. For a low-carb option, serve the chicken with a side of steamed broccoli or cauliflower instead of grains. To accommodate different dietary preferences, consider marinating tofu or portobello mushrooms in the same lemon herb mixture for a vegetarian alternative."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I prepare chicken breasts for grilling?","answer":"Start by trimming any excess fat or tendons from the chicken breasts. You can also pound them gently to an even thickness for more uniform cooking."},{"question":"What can I use instead of fresh parsley?","answer":"If you don't have fresh parsley, you can substitute it with dried parsley (use about a teaspoon) or try using basil or cilantro for a different flavor."},{"question":"How long should I marinate the chicken?","answer":"Marinate the chicken for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to penetrate. For best results, marinate for up to 2 hours in the refrigerator."},{"question":"What is the best way to check if chicken is fully cooked?","answer":"The safest way to check is by using a meat thermometer. Insert it into the thickest part of the chicken; it should read at least 165°F (75°C). If you don’t have a thermometer, cut into the chicken to ensure the juices run clear and there’s no pink meat inside."},{"question":"How can I avoid chicken sticking to the grill?","answer":"Make sure your grill is preheated and lightly oil the grates before adding the chicken. You can also brush a little olive oil on the chicken before grilling."},{"question":"What do I do if I don’t have a grill?","answer":"You can cook the chicken in a grill pan on the stovetop or bake it in the oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 25-30 minutes until fully cooked."},{"question":"Can I use this marinade for other proteins?","answer":"Absolutely! This marinade works well with fish, shrimp, or even vegetables like zucchini and bell peppers."},{"question":"How should I store leftover grilled chicken?","answer":"Store any leftover grilled chicken in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days.

Consider a light lemon vinaigrette on your salad to complement the dish!"},{"question":"Why is it important to let the chicken rest after cooking?","answer":"Letting the chicken rest for about 5 minutes helps the juices redistribute, making the chicken juicier and more flavorful when you slice into it."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"chicken breasts","advice":"Choose boneless, skinless chicken breasts for quick cooking and ease of handling. If you prefer dark meat, chicken thighs can be used as a substitute, providing a richer flavor. For a juicier chicken, consider brining the breasts in a saltwater solution for a couple of hours before marinating."},{"name":"lemon juice","advice":"Freshly squeezed lemon juice is best for a bright, vibrant flavor; however, bottled lemon juice can be used in a pinch. If you're looking for a different tartness, try substituting with lime juice or apple cider vinegar."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Extra virgin olive oil offers the best flavor, but you can substitute with avocado oil or canola oil if you prefer a higher smoke point. Adding a bit of flavored olive oil (like garlic-infused) can enhance the taste."},{"name":"garlic cloves, minced","advice":"Fresh garlic provides a stronger taste than pre-minced or powdered garlic. If you're short on fresh garlic, you can use 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder per clove as a substitute. Roasting the garlic before mincing it can add a sweeter, mellower flavor."},{"name":"fresh parsley, chopped","advice":"Flat-leaf parsley (Italian parsley) has a more robust flavor than curly parsley and is recommended for this recipe. If you don’t have parsley, fresh cilantro or basil can be used as a substitute, but they will alter the flavor profile."},{"name":"dried oregano","advice":"Dried oregano is more concentrated than fresh, so use about one-third of the fresh amount if substituting. For a different flavor note, try using dried thyme or Italian seasoning instead."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Kosher salt is preferred for even seasoning, but table salt or sea salt can also be used. Adjust the amount based on your dietary needs or if you're using salted ingredients elsewhere in the dish."},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly cracked black pepper offers better flavor than pre-ground pepper. If you want to spice things up, consider adding a pinch of red pepper flakes or using white pepper for a different heat profile."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673acbfa94ab1a8249ab70ef","name":"Lemon Herb Grilled Chicken","ingredients":[{"name":"chicken breasts","quantity":"4 pieces","_id":"673acbfe94ab1a8249ab7100"},{"name":"lemon juice","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"673acbfe94ab1a8249ab7101"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"673acbfe94ab1a8249ab7102"},{"name":"garlic cloves, minced","quantity":"2","_id":"673acbfe94ab1a8249ab7103"},{"name":"fresh parsley, chopped","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"673acbfe94ab1a8249ab7104"},{"name":"dried oregano","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"673acbfe94ab1a8249ab7105"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"673acbfe94ab1a8249ab7106"},{"name":"black pepper","quantity":"1/2 teaspoon","_id":"673acbfe94ab1a8249ab7107"}],"calories":250,"allergens":[],"dietaryTags":["Gluten-Free","Low-Carb","High-Protein"],"difficultyPercent":30,"price":10,"preparationTime":15,"cookingTime":20,"tags":["Grilled","Chicken","Healthy","Quick","Easy"],"quickTastyDescription":"Juicy grilled chicken marinated in a zesty lemon herb mix, perfect for a quick and healthy meal.","detailedCookingInstructions":["In a bowl, mix lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, parsley, oregano, salt, and pepper.","Place the chicken breasts in a ziplock bag or shallow dish and pour the marinade over the chicken.","Seal the bag or cover the dish, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes (or up to 2 hours for more flavor).","Preheat your grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.","Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinade.","Grill the chicken for about 6-7 minutes on each side, or until fully cooked and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C).","Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving."],"createdByModel":"4o","detailedName":"Lemon Herb Grilled Chicken","baseMeal":"Grilled Chicken","modifiersForBase":"Lemon and Herb Marinade","imageUrl":"/images/lemon-herb-grilled-chicken-66dfdd05f5069b93fce7da77.webp","image":"66dfdd05f5069b93fce7da77","servings":4,"cuisine":["American","Mediterranean"],"course":["Main Course","Dinner"],"dateCreated":"2024-11-18T05:09:18.595Z","createdAt":"2024-11-18T05:09:18.596Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-19T05:35:49.068Z","__v":0,"mealUrl":"lemon-herb-grilled-chicken-673acbfa94ab1a8249ab70ef"},"__v":0}}
