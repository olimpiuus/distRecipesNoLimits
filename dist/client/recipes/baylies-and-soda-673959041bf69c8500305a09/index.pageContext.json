The creamy sweetness of the Baileys complements the chocolate beautifully. Additionally, a light charcuterie board featuring mild cheeses, nuts, and dried fruits can enhance the flavor experience. As for beverages, a light white wine like a Riesling or a fruity cocktail can also serve as a refreshing complement to the drink.","serving_suggestions":"To elevate your Baileys and Soda experience, serve it in a chilled glass to maintain optimal temperature.

This drink is perfect for relaxed gatherings, casual brunches, or as a comforting evening treat.","dietary_considerations":"Baileys Irish Cream contains dairy, making this drink unsuitable for those with lactose intolerance or dairy allergies.

If you want to substitute it, consider using another cream liqueur like Amarula or a homemade version with cream, whiskey, and chocolate syrup. To enhance its flavor, you can add a splash of vanilla extract or a sprinkle of cocoa powder when mixing."},{"name":"Club Soda","advice":"Club soda is carbonated water that adds fizz to your drink.

To enhance the drink, you can infuse the soda with a slice of cucumber or a few mint leaves before adding it to the glass."},{"name":"Ice","advice":"Using fresh, clean ice is crucial for maintaining the drink's chill. You can use crushed ice for a slushy texture or larger cubes for slower dilution. For a flavored twist, freeze some fruit or herbs into the ice cubes beforehand."},{"name":"Lime Wedge","advice":"Lime adds a nice citrusy brightness to the drink. If you don’t have fresh lime, lemon can be a good substitute. For a different flavor profile, consider using a splash of lemon-lime soda instead of the wedge. To further enhance the drink, run the lime wedge around the rim of the glass and dip it in salt or sugar for a flavorful rim."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673959041bf69c8500305a09","name":"Baylies and Soda","ingredients":[{"name":"bailys irish cream","quantity":"2 oz","_id":"673959051bf69c8500305a17"},{"name":"club soda","quantity":"4 oz","_id":"673959051bf69c8500305a18"},{"name":"ice","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673959051bf69c8500305a19"},{"name":"lime wedge","quantity":"1","_id":"673959051bf69c8500305a1a"}],"calories":200,"allergens":["Dairy","Alcohol"],"dietaryTags":["Vegetarian"],"difficultyPercent":10,"price":5,"preparationTime":5,"cookingTime":0,"tags":["Drink","Easy","Refreshing"],"quickTastyDescription":"A refreshing and bubbly drink with a hint of sweetness, perfect for any occasion.","detailedCookingInstructions":["Fill a glass with ice.","Pour 2 oz of Baileys Irish Cream over the ice.","Top it off with 4 oz of club soda.","Gently stir to combine.","Garnish with a lime wedge and enjoy!"],"createdByModel":"4o","detailedName":"Baileys Irish Cream with Club Soda","baseMeal":"Beverage","modifiersForBase":"Add ice and lime for a refreshing twist","imageUrl":"/images/baylies-and-soda-673959041bf69c8500305a0f.webp","image":"673959041bf69c8500305a0f","servings":1,"cuisine":["Irish","American"],"course":["Beverage"],"dateCreated":"2024-11-17T02:46:29.975Z","createdAt":"2024-11-17T02:46:29.976Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-19T05:35:48.131Z","__v":0,"mealUrl":"baylies-and-soda-673959041bf69c8500305a09"},"__v":0}}
