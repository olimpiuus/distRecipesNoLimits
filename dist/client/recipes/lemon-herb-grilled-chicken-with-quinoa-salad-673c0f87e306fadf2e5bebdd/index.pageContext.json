Mix well to create a marinade."},{"name":"Marinate the Chicken","description":"Add the 2 large chicken breasts to the marinade, ensuring they are well coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a lid and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes. For best flavor, marinate for up to 2 hours."},{"name":"Cook the Quinoa","description":"While the chicken is marinating, rinse 1 cup of quinoa under cold water in a fine-mesh sieve. In a medium pot, combine the rinsed quinoa with 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes or until all the water is absorbed. Turn off the heat and let it sit covered for an additional 5 minutes. Fluff the quinoa with a fork."},{"name":"Prepare the Salad","description":"In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked quinoa with 1 diced cucumber, 1 cup of halved cherry tomatoes, 1/4 finely chopped red onion, and 1/4 cup of chopped fresh parsley. Drizzle with olive oil and lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix gently to combine all ingredients."},{"name":"Grill the Chicken","description":"Preheat your grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade, letting any excess drip off. Grill the chicken for about 6-7 minutes on each side, or until fully cooked (internal temperature should reach 165°F/74°C and juices run clear). After grilling, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before slicing."},{"name":"Serve and Enjoy","description":"Plate the grilled chicken alongside the quinoa salad. Drizzle with any remaining dressing from the salad bowl if desired. Enjoy your healthy and delicious Lemon Herb Grilled Chicken with Quinoa Salad!"}],"pairings":{"pairings":"For a delightful pairing, consider serving the Lemon Herb Grilled Chicken with a crisp white wine such as Sauvignon Blanc or a light-bodied rosé to complement the citrus and herb notes of the dish. If you prefer non-alcoholic options, a sparkling water infused with lemon or cucumber would be refreshing. To add protein, grilled shrimp or a side of chickpeas can enhance the meal, while a side of grilled asparagus or a fresh arugula salad can provide extra greens and crunch.","serving_suggestions":"Serve the grilled chicken sliced over a bed of quinoa salad, allowing the vibrant colors of the salad to show through. Garnish with additional chopped parsley or lemon wedges for a pop of color and flavor. For an elegant dining experience, consider plating the chicken and quinoa salad on a large platter family-style, allowing guests to serve themselves. This dish is excellent warm but can also be enjoyed at room temperature, making it ideal for outdoor gatherings or picnics.","dietary_considerations":"This dish is naturally gluten-free and can accommodate various dietary preferences. For a vegan alternative, replace chicken with marinated grilled tofu or tempeh, and substitute quinoa with a base of mixed greens. If you're looking for a lower-carb option, consider cauliflower rice instead of quinoa. For those watching their sodium intake, use low-sodium soy sauce or coconut aminos in the marinade, and skip the added salt in the salad."},"faqs":[{"question":"How do I prepare chicken breasts for grilling?","answer":"Start by trimming any excess fat from the chicken breasts. If they are thick, consider pounding them to an even thickness to ensure they cook evenly. This will help prevent the outside from burning while the inside remains undercooked."},{"question":"What is the best way to marinate chicken?","answer":"Combine your marinade ingredients in a bowl and add the chicken. Make sure to coat it evenly. For best flavor, let it marinate for at least 15 minutes, but longer (up to 2 hours) is even better if you have time to spare."},{"question":"How do I know when the quinoa is cooked?","answer":"Quinoa is done when it has absorbed all the water and the little spirals (the germ) separate from the seed. This usually takes about 15 minutes. After removing it from heat, let it sit covered for 5 more minutes before fluffing it with a fork."},{"question":"What is the proper way to grill chicken?","answer":"Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Grill the chicken for 6-7 minutes on each side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C). Use a meat thermometer for accuracy, as this ensures it’s safe to eat."},{"question":"How can I safely handle raw chicken?","answer":"Always wash your hands before and after handling raw chicken to prevent cross-contamination. Use separate cutting boards and utensils for raw meat and other ingredients. Clean surfaces with hot, soapy water afterward."},{"question":"What can I substitute for quinoa?","answer":"If you don't have quinoa, you can substitute with rice, couscous, or bulgur wheat. Keep in mind that the cooking times and water ratios will vary depending on the substitute you choose."},{"question":"How do I make my salad more flavorful?","answer":"Add a drizzle of olive oil and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to your salad. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and consider adding other herbs or spices that you enjoy for extra flavor."},{"question":"What should I do if I overcooked the chicken?","answer":"If the chicken is dry, try slicing it thinly and mixing it into a salad or wrap with a sauce to add moisture. Alternatively, you can chop it and use it in soups or stews to help retain some juiciness."},{"question":"Can I grill chicken without a grill?","answer":"Yes! You can use a grill pan on your stovetop or even bake the chicken in the oven. If baking, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and bake for about 25-30 minutes, or until fully cooked."},{"question":"How do I store leftovers safely?","answer":"Allow your chicken and quinoa salad to cool to room temperature before transferring them to airtight containers. Store in the refrigerator and consume within 3-4 days for best quality."}],"ingredients":[{"name":"chicken breasts","advice":"Choose boneless, skinless chicken breasts for easier grilling and a quicker cook time. If you want a more flavorful option, consider marinating overnight. If you need a substitute, turkey cutlets or tofu can work, but adjust cooking times accordingly."},{"name":"olive oil","advice":"Use extra virgin olive oil for its superior flavor and health benefits. If you're out of olive oil, avocado oil or canola oil are good substitutes. You can also infuse the olive oil with herbs for extra flavor."},{"name":"lemon juice","advice":"Fresh lemon juice is best for a bright, zesty flavor. If you don't have fresh lemons, bottled lemon juice will suffice, but it may not be as vibrant. Lime juice can also be used as a substitute for a different citrus twist."},{"name":"garlic (minced)","advice":"Fresh minced garlic will provide the best flavor. If you need to substitute, use garlic powder (1/8 teaspoon per clove) but add it later in the cooking process to avoid bitterness. Roasted garlic can also be a sweeter alternative."},{"name":"dried oregano","advice":"Dried oregano is convenient, but fresh oregano offers more intense flavor; use three times the amount if substituting. You can also experiment with other dried herbs like thyme or Italian seasoning for variation."},{"name":"salt","advice":"Use kosher salt for better control and flavor. If you're watching sodium intake, consider using sea salt or a salt-free seasoning blend. Taste as you go to ensure you don't over-season."},{"name":"black pepper","advice":"Freshly cracked black pepper has a much stronger flavor than pre-ground pepper. If you need a substitute, white pepper can work, but it has a different taste profile."},{"name":"quinoa","advice":"Rinse quinoa thoroughly before cooking to remove the bitter saponins. If quinoa isn't available, couscous or bulgur can be used as a substitute, keeping in mind their cooking times may vary."},{"name":"water","advice":"Using broth instead of water to cook the quinoa can add depth of flavor. If you're low on broth, a mix of water and a splash of lemon juice can also enhance the taste."},{"name":"cucumber (diced)","advice":"For crunch, use English cucumbers which have fewer seeds and thinner skin. If you want extra flavor, try marinating the diced cucumber in a bit of vinegar before adding it to the salad."},{"name":"cherry tomatoes (halved)","advice":"Choose ripe, sweet cherry tomatoes for the best flavor. If unavailable, grape tomatoes or even diced larger tomatoes can work. Roasting the tomatoes beforehand can also enhance their sweetness."},{"name":"red onion (finely chopped)","advice":"Soaking chopped red onion in cold water for 10 minutes will mellow its sharp flavor. If you prefer a sweeter onion, consider using sweet onions like Vidalia or green onions as a substitute."},{"name":"fresh parsley (chopped)","advice":"Fresh parsley adds a burst of flavor and color. If you don't have parsley, fresh cilantro or basil can be used as substitutes, but each will impart a different flavor profile."}],"mealId":{"occasions":[],"SEOLongkeywords":[],"_id":"673c0f87e306fadf2e5bebdd","name":"Lemon Herb Grilled Chicken with Quinoa Salad","ingredients":[{"name":"chicken breasts","quantity":"2 large","_id":"673c0f8be306fadf2e5bebf7"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"673c0f8be306fadf2e5bebf8"},{"name":"lemon juice","quantity":"2 tablespoons","_id":"673c0f8be306fadf2e5bebf9"},{"name":"garlic (minced)","quantity":"2 cloves","_id":"673c0f8be306fadf2e5bebfa"},{"name":"dried oregano","quantity":"1 teaspoon","_id":"673c0f8be306fadf2e5bebfb"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673c0f8be306fadf2e5bebfc"},{"name":"black pepper","quantity":"to taste","_id":"673c0f8be306fadf2e5bebfd"},{"name":"quinoa","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673c0f8be306fadf2e5bebfe"},{"name":"water","quantity":"2 cups","_id":"673c0f8be306fadf2e5bebff"},{"name":"cucumber (diced)","quantity":"1","_id":"673c0f8be306fadf2e5bec00"},{"name":"cherry tomatoes (halved)","quantity":"1 cup","_id":"673c0f8be306fadf2e5bec01"},{"name":"red onion (finely chopped)","quantity":"1/4","_id":"673c0f8be306fadf2e5bec02"},{"name":"fresh parsley (chopped)","quantity":"1/4 cup","_id":"673c0f8be306fadf2e5bec03"}],"calories":450,"allergens":[],"dietaryTags":["gluten-free","high-protein"],"difficultyPercent":30,"price":12.5,"preparationTime":15,"cookingTime":20,"tags":["grilled chicken","quinoa salad","healthy","easy meal"],"quickTastyDescription":"Juicy grilled chicken marinated in zesty lemon and fresh herbs, served with a refreshing quinoa salad loaded with vegetables.","detailedCookingInstructions":["In a bowl, mix olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper.
